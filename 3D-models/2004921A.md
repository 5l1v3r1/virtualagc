The models are created to the exact dimensions the original drawings. Two decision have been made:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.


Ambiguity for the small vertical wall: is it starting from the very bottom of the part (4 chamfered corners), or the wide bottom (at .080)? Chose the latter as reference.
