# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions the original drawings. Two decision have been made:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes

* Uncertainty as the right pocket for the alert display isn't perfectly centered... Quotation shows 4.03in, instead of 4.00. 
* Fillets are often not specified, and .09 default value **seems** too small. Left as is. 
* Some fillets aren't possible and are excluded
