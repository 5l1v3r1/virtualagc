# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions the original drawings. Two decision have been made:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes
* Fillets: 2D sketch for the pockets differ in the two holes for support, as .60R fillets would alter geometry. Some corners have been left as is. 
* Ribs: there is still some doubt about the rib's thickness, as it doesn't match the internal ones.
