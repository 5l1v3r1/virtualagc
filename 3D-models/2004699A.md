# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions from the original drawings. A few decisions were taken when re-creating them:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes
* Chamfer inside the display opening lacks distance information. Set to .01 (x45Â°)
