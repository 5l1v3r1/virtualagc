# General notes
The models are created to the exact dimensions from the original drawings. A few decisions were taken when re-creating them:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
* Part numbering (stenciled paint) are not added into model.

SolidWorks was used for the parametric drawings. Contact me (ManoDaSilva) you need them.

# Specific notes

* Fillets are often not specified, and .09 default value **seems** too small. Left as is. 
* Some fillets aren't possible and are excluded
* Center ribs should all be there, but the schematic is unclear on where they might be. Used photographic evidence to guesstimate their position (dimensions are fixed by the drawings). 
* Model based off 2004929-, with the modifications from 2004739A-000. Widened alarm window.
