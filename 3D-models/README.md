This folder contains 3D models of the Apollo Guidance Computer. 
So far, work has been focused on the DSKY, but any contribution regarding the AGC is welcome. 

The models are created to the exact dimensions the original drawings. Two decision have been made:
* Threaded bores are modelled as simple holes;
* Engineering intervals (e.g. [2.304-2.296]) have been averaged. 
Whenever other differences exist, the attached .md file will acknowledge it. 

The files follow the naming convention established by the VirtualAGC Project. Two sub-folders are included: 
* img: contains the drawings from which the models are based. Useful notes and remarks are included in them (regarding tolerances, threads and so on); they should always follow the CAD models.
* sldwrks: the Solidworks parametric files, some still WIP.
