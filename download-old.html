it's targeted at enthusiasts.&nbsp; Stephan's (the line

For Win32 users, it's much more work to get your computer set up
to build Virtual AGC than it is in Linux, and the steps needed
will be less familiar.&nbsp; Therefore, most of you will feel
inclined to simply install the Virtual AGC programs rather than
compiling them from scratch.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are
already a software developer using MinGW, you will probably want
to build the software rather than installing the binaries, to
avoid gumming up your \mingw directory.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; Since it's
inconvenient for me to build the Win32 packages, they may not be

AGC software, in Linux<br></h2><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer:</span>&nbsp; On a number of
Linux platforms, I've had no problem at all building the Virtual
AGC suite.&nbsp; (These include SuSE 9.0-10.0, RedHat 7.3, and
Ubuntu 5.04.)&nbsp; But on some, it's much trickier.&nbsp; In
cases like that, I'd suggest trying to install the binaries (see
above) rather than building from source.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Prerequisites:</span>&nbsp; gcc, pkg-config, autoconf, automake,
glib-dev, libgtk, libgtk-dev 2.0 or higher, readline-devel,
either curses or ncurses, and the <a href=
"http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a> cross-platform GUI
kit.<br><br>
To unpack the tarball, you work from a command-line prompt.&nbsp;
The development-snapshot tarball, for example, is unpacked as
follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf

instead of using the command "./configure", use the command
"./configure --prefix=<span style=

the curses library (which is what we'd like to have

the file libncurses.a (usually, in /usr/lib) and do
this before running <span style=

"font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> version 2.2.x.)&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the names of the packages you need to
install will differ by Linux distribution, unless you
choose to install gtk+ from source (in which case no
separate "dev" package is needed).&nbsp; They may be
something like "gtk2" and "gtk2-dev", or "gtk+2" and
"gtk+2-dev", or even (I'm told) something as obscure as
"libgtk+2.0_0-devel".&nbsp; For some reason, on my
computer, the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH
needed for the "configure" step is not set properly by
the&nbsp; installation of gtk+.&nbsp; If you encounter
this problem, the "configure" step will display
instructions as to how it may be easily fixed.&nbsp; If
you don't get a message, you probably don't need to
worry about it.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul><li>It may be that you just can't build the software,

that all of the programs will build fine except for
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>.&nbsp;
In this case, as a last resort, you can use the
following alternate build instructions:</li></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd yaAGC<br>

or "SimArtemis072", run "SimLuminary131_lite",
"SimColossus249_lite", or "SimArtemis072_lite".&nbsp;
What these steps will do for you is to bypass building
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>, and to
use instead the "DSKY Lite" module of the <span style=

AGC software, in Windows</h2><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; I don't use Windows
myself, if I can help it, and so will have no great enthusiasm
for helping you if you have trouble with the Windows version of
the simulation.&nbsp; With that said, I am at this instant
(07/17/04, 09:43 am.) watching four separate LM simulations,
including a Win32 DSKY attached to a Win32 AGC, a Win32 DSKY
attached to a Linux AGC, a Linux DSKY attached to a Win32 AGC,
and a Linux DSKY attached to a Linux AGC.&nbsp; They all seem to
be working properly.<br><br>
Before doing anything else, <a href=
"WinGtkHowto.html#BigBox">install the MinGW C-language compiler
and the gtk+ toolkit</a><a name=WinTarball id="WinTarball"></a>
on your computer.&nbsp; The makefiles provided in the tarball
assume that you have done this in exactly the way I prescribe,
though possibly with different versions of some software
packages, and may not work if <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span> and/or <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> have been installed slightly
differently.&nbsp; Those of you who know about such things may
wonder if it wouldn't be easier to build Virtual AGC using
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a>.&nbsp; The
answer is that I think it would be preferable, but I haven't been
able to get it to work.&nbsp; (Anybody who figures it out should
let me know how you did it.)<br><br>
If you want to build <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, you'll need the <a href=
"http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a> cross-platform GUI
kit.&nbsp; If you don't want to bother with <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, you don't have to.&nbsp; The
build-process (below) will display warnings, but won't
abort.&nbsp; However, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> gives you the ability to use
the rotational hand controller (RHC) in the LM, and that
substantially adds to the fun-factor of using the simulation.<br><br>
One result of following the installation instructions is that an
icon for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> should now
appear on your desktop.&nbsp; <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> is a command-line environment
which is similar to the command-line environment found in
Linux.&nbsp; It is not needed for <span style=
"font-style: italic;">running</span> any of the Virtual AGC
programs you'll be creating, but you will work within the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> enviroment when
<span style="font-style: italic;">building</span> the
programs.&nbsp; Therefore, the first step is to click the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> icon and enter the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> command-line
environment.<br><br>
For versions 20040810 or later, you will also need to install
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/">POSIX Threads
for Win32</a>.&nbsp; While I can't guarantee that the folks who
develop that software won't change their installation procedure,
as of 20040814 this is what worked for me:<br><ul><li>Download the self-extracting file and extract the software
into your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> home
directory.&nbsp; (For me, that's "c:\msys\1.0\home\Ronald
Burkey".&nbsp; For you, it will naturally different.)</li><li>From the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span>
command line, do this:</li></ul><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd
pthreads</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">make</span><br style=

c:/mingw/include</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cp -a *.a
c:/mingw/lib</span><br></div>Next, you need a way of getting the source-code tarball
into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span>
environment.&nbsp; The <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span>/<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> installation instructions give
some hints as to how to do that.&nbsp; Once you've done that,
perform the following steps:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf
yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2</span><br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd yaAGC</span><br style=
"font-family: monospace;"></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">make install</span><br></div><br>
(If you are using Virtual AGC versions prior to 20040810, you'll
need "make -f Makefile.Win32 clean install" instead.)&nbsp;
Assuming the steps above were successful, you are now done with
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> environment, and
may exit it simply by using the command "exit".<br><br>
The net result of this is that the Virtual AGC executable
programs will now appear in the c:\mingw\bin directory, which you
should add to your PATH.<br><br>
Finally, if you want to run Stephan Hotto's contributed <a href=
"developer.html"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a> software (and you
probably do!), you'll have to install <a href=
"http://www.tcl.tk/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span></a> for it to work.&nbsp; I'd
strongly suggest doing this.<br><br>
It may be that you just can't build the software, no matter how
hard you try.&nbsp; In almost all cases, the reason for this will
be a problem in configuration of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> (with which I'll probably be
unable to help), and that all of the programs will build fine
except for <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>.&nbsp; In this
case, as a last resort, you can do the following:<br><ol><li>Instead of "make install", do "make NOGUI=yes

bag.&nbsp; If this works, you'll be lucky.&nbsp; (But it does
work for me.)&nbsp; My system is an iMac with Mac OS X
10.2.8.&nbsp; The instructions below are relatively new; if you
want to see the old instructions, <a href=
"ArchivedMacOsX.html">look here</a>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span><br><ol><li>Please install Apple's "developer tools", from the CD that
came with MacOS X.&nbsp; If your version of the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gcc</span> program is 3.1 or prior, there
is an upgrade to <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>
3.3 which you'll want to download from Apple and install.&nbsp;
(You can tell by running the command "gcc -v" from the command
line interface to view the version number.)&nbsp;
Unfortunately, you'll have to sign up as an <a href=
"http://connect.apple.com">Apple developer</a> (which is free)
in order to download it.&nbsp; What you're looking for is a
"gcc updater", of which there are several (depending on your
version of MacOS X), so I can't really advise you as to which
of them needs to be downloaded.<br></li><li>Please install <a href=
"http://fink.sourceforge.net"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span></a>, which is a program that
is used to install other programs.&nbsp; Make sure that you
choose the version of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> that works with your version
of Mac OS X, and follow the instructions on the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> webpage.&nbsp; There is a
graphical front end for <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> called <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Fink Commander</span>, which you'll have
to <span style="font-style: italic;">manually drag onto your
desktop</span>, as it is not automatically installed by the
installer program.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fink
Commander</span>.&nbsp; From the main menu, do
FinkCommander/Preferences, and click the tab that says
Fink.&nbsp; Activate "Use unstable packages".<br></li><li>Running Virtual AGC will require the X-window system (also
known as "xdarwin", "xfree86", "xorg", or "X11").&nbsp; If you
already have this installed and are satisfied with it, you
probably should ignore this step.&nbsp; However, what I did to
install the X-window system is this:&nbsp; with <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Fink Commander</span>, install the
<span style="font-style: italic;">binary packages</span>
(rather than the source packages) for "xfree86" and
"icewm-basic".&nbsp; After Fink Commander finishes its
business, create a text file called ".xinitrc" in your home
directory which contains a single line reading "exec
/sw/bin/icewm".<br></li><li>With <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fink
Commander</span>, install the <span style=
"font-style: italic;">binary packages</span> (rather than the
source packages) for the following programs:&nbsp; "automake",
"tcltk", "cvs", "readline", and "readline-shlibs".</li><li>With <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fink
Commander</span>, install the <span style=
"font-style: italic;">source package</span> "gtk+2-dev".&nbsp;
This will probably take quite a long time, but (as of this
writing) the much-quicker-installing binary package for
gtk+2-dev provided by <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> is not up-to-date enough to
build Virtual AGC. &nbsp; You may be presented with the choice
between "pango1-xft1" and "pango1-xft2"; choose
"pango1-xft2".<br></li><li>Install the <a href=
"http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a> cross-platform GUI
kit.&nbsp; This can't be done at present from <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span>.&nbsp; If you're only going to
try installing the Virtual AGC binary package, you might try
simply downloading the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> runtime library dmg file
and installing it.&nbsp; (But I should tell you I haven't tried
it, and have no way at present to try it.&nbsp; Let me know if
it works for you.)&nbsp; What I do instead is build
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> from source.
&nbsp; Building <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>

(Note that I personally have no way to test this, but I've had
some reports that it works.)<br><br>
From a command-line, do the following, assuming that you've
downloaded both the Virtual AGC binary package
(yaAGC-macosx-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2) and
developer snapshot.<br><br></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop</span><br><span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo tar --directory=/

Running the program is a little more complex than you're used
to:
</div><ul><ul><li>Run the X-window system.&nbsp; If you followed my
instructions for installing the X-window system, there will
be a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, and you can click
the little CRT button on it to open up an "xterm"
command-line interface.&nbsp; (If you didn't follow my
instructions, you'll have to figure out for yourself how to
run <span style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span>.)<br></li><li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span>
window, type the following:</li></ul></ul><div style="margin-left: 120px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">set path = ($path
/usr/local/yaAGC/bin)</span><br style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">SimLuminary131
--half-size<br></span></div><ul><ul><li>If you installed the X-window system differently than I
suggested, the simulated DSKY may not immediately display on
the screen.&nbsp; Instead, the cursor may simply change
shape, indicating that it wants you to position the DSKY on
the screen.&nbsp; Click on the screen, and the simulated DSKY
will appear where you click.&nbsp; You'll may similarly have
to position the DEDA, and so on.<br></li></ul></ul><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If this didn't work properly, you may need to build Virtual AGC
from source.<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trying to build Virtual
AGC from source:</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you are unable to get the binary package to work, but have
followed the steps above, you can try to build Virtual AGC from
source.&nbsp; Just do this from a command-line:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd
yaAGC</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">./configure
--prefix=/sw</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">make<br>
sudo make install</span><br></div></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
When you try to run the simulation, you do the same thing as
instructed above (for the binary installation), but you don't
need the "<span style="font-family: monospace;">set path
...</span>" command.<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bypassing compilation of
yaDSKY:</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
One of the main difficulties that people seem to have in
building Virtual AGC is the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> and <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> applications.&nbsp; It's
possible to do without <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> by using the "DSKY Lite"
built into the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> program.&nbsp; (Sadly,
there's no substitute at present for <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>, but <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span> isn't as important to most
people as <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>.)&nbsp; So modify the steps
listed above as follows:<br><ol style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><li>Instead of "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">./configure --prefix=/sw</span>",
do "<span style="font-family: monospace;">make NOGUI=yes
PREFIX=/sw</span> <span style=
"font-family: monospace;">autogen</span>".</li><li>Instead of "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">make</span>", do "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">make NOGUI=yes</span>".<br></li><li>Instead of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo
make install</span>", do "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">sudo make NOGUI=yes
install</span>".</li><li>Instead of running <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>, or <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimArtemis072</span>, run <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131_lite</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249_lite</span>, or
<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimArtemis072_lite</span>.<br></li></ol></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">If all else
fails:</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="ArchivedMacOsX.html">Look here</a> for the way I
<span style="font-style: italic;">used to</span> advise doing
all this.<br></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Uninstalling:</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you installed the binary package, you can uninstall just
removing the directories that were created:<br><br></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo rm -rf
/usr/local/yaAGC</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">rm -rf yaAGC<br></span>
Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fink Commander</span> to
uninstall the prerequisites I asked you to install.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
If you built from source, there's no good way to uninstall,
aside from just figuring out all the files that were created,
and deleting them.&nbsp; I don't have a comprehensive list of
files in Virtual AGC at the moment.&nbsp; However, you're only
talking a few megabytes, so it usually won't be a problem just
to let the files alone.<br></div><h2><a name=Ten_4_3 id="Ten_4_3"></a>Installing Virtual AGC
Binaries in Mac OS X (10.4)<br></h2><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=
"ArchivedMacOsX.html">I used to explain</a> how to install
Virtual AGC binaries in Mac OS X, as well as how to build from
source (see above).&nbsp; However, it was almost as hard as
building from source, so I eventually removed the
instructions.&nbsp; I'm told that it has become relatively easy
in Mac OS X 10.4, so we have some new instructions thanks to
Fabrizio Bernardini.&nbsp; I haven't any way to try them myself,
but Fabrizio knows what he's doing.&nbsp; I've cut-and-pasted
directly from his email.<br><br><table summary="" style=

Thanks to the availability of a brand new PowerBook I had to reload yaAGC and its stuff once more.<br><br>And thanks to the outstanding quality of the overall system provided by Apple (sorry for the ad, but it changes your life) installing the binaries is now simpler than currently cited in the download page.<br><br>Here are the steps I performed:<br><br>Initial conditions: MacOS Tiger 10.4.3 installed and configured as it is out of the box.<br><br>1. Run the Dev Tools installer situated in /Applications/Installers (if you are reading these you probably already performed that).<br><br>2. Install X11 from the Options package available in the MacOS Tiger Installation Disc. When you double-click the installer a selection window will open: everything should already been installed but X11, check it and go ahead.<br><br>3. Check that X11 works by double-clicking on the X11 icon now available in /Applications/Utilities.<br><br>4. Download from //fink.sourceforge.net/ the lates stable relase of fink. I got version 0.8.0 released on 09 June 2005.<br><br>5. Install fink double-clicking its installer package from the disk image (.dmg) file downlaoded. Let it create the /sw directory. Installing FinkCommander is an option, not required if you need fink for yaAGC only, or install it later.<br><br>6. Open a terminal shell and run the following fink request:<br><br>  $ fink install gtk+2<br><br>Running this command requires the computer to be connected to the Internet. Let it run and say Yes to requests.<br><br>7. Install yaAGC binaries in /usr/local<br><br>8. Upon successful completion of the above steps, starts X11 and:<br><br>     a. Open a term shell<br>        b. $ cd /usr/local/yaAGC/bin<br>        c. $ ./yaAGC --core=Luminary131.bin --port=19797 --cfg=LM.ini<br>       d. Open another term shell<br>  e. $ cd /usr/local/yaAGC/bin<br>        f. $ ./yadsky --half-size --cfg=LM.ini --port=19797<br><br>   and everything runs !<br><br>9. Bonus step: now the TCL/TK toolkit is included in the developer tools so it is already installed and if you wish you can open another term shell and run also LM_Simulator with no troubles !<br><br>Conclusions: MacOS is demonstrating itself as one of the best developing platforms ever conceived out of a box. Please note that only the gtk libraries where required in addition to the dev tools add ons.<br><br>I will perform the same procedures also on a iMac and will report the results soon.<br><br>Now is anybody so lucky to be able to try the same on an Intel iMac with Tiger 10.4.4 ?</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><center><br><span style=
