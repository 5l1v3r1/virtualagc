    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<br>
    </h1>
    <p>This page is devoted to the electrical and mechanical aspects of
      the AGC and DSKY, and more broadly, to the electrical and
      mechanical aspects of the entire Apollo CM and LM G&amp;N
      (guidance and navigation) system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This is an ongoing effort.&nbsp; The long-range goal — or perhaps
      "wish" is a more-accurate term — is to provide the following
      engineering resources:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The complete set of engineering drawings (electrical
        schematics and mechanical drawings) for AGC/DSKY and other
        G&amp;N components, in all revisions, in the form of scanned
        images of the original Apollo Program drawings.</li>
      <li>Contemporary Apollo Program theory-of-operation documents for
        the above.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Electrically and visually accurate transcriptions of those
        electrical schematics into a modern open-source electrical CAD
        program.</li>
      <li>Accurate translation of mechanical drawings of fabricated
        parts into reusable 3D models.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Translation of AGC electrical design into Verilog
        hardware-description language or other standardized languages
        when appropriate.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Simulation of the AGC hardware, via modern open-source
        Verilog-simulation software, or other software when appropriate.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Great strides have been made toward the goal, but it nevertheless
      remains very distant.<br>

    To find any given drawing by its drawing number, first look in the
    "box" that covers that drawing-number range first.&nbsp; Then
    consult the "miscellaneous" drawings if what you want is missing
    from the box or is illegible, or is simply too early a
    revision.&nbsp; The exceptions are mil specs (drawings with numbers
    like MS<i>xxxx</i> or NAS<i>xxxx</i>).<br>

    <h1> </h1>
    <p> </p>
    In this section, the engineering drawings are provided on a
    mission-by-mission basis.&nbsp; I expect to be acquiring drawings to
    help fill in gaps in the drawing hierarchy at least through the end
    of 2020, though the collection will necessarily still be incomplete
    even when that process has come to an end.<br>
    <br>
    Each mission had either one or two G&amp;N (Guidance &amp;
    Navigation) systems installed:&nbsp; one for the CM and/or one for
    the LM.&nbsp; Each G&amp;N system is identified by a numerical
    assembly number (<a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch10Images#page/n234/mode/2up">1014999</a>
    for Block I CM, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch4Images#page/n197/mode/2up">2014999</a>
    for Block II CM, <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1uphttps://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1up">6014999</a>
    for LM) plus a 3-digit configuration number (-000, -021, -031, ... ,
    -221) that changed from one mission to the next.&nbsp; For example,
    the Apollo 11 LM had G&amp;N system 6014999-091.&nbsp; Note, by the
    way, that we're presenting these assemblies entirely from a NASA
    perspective; changes were made to the G&amp;N system configurations
    <i>after</i> MIT/IL delivered them to NASA, and there's a completely
    different set of drawings (1015000, 2015000, 6015000) that describe
    the G&amp;N system configurations at the time they were shipped to
    NASA. <br>
    <br>
    Such a G&amp;N system is represented by a set of engineering
    drawings. Given the drawings of the G&amp;N system, you can then
    look at the drawings of any of its sub-assemblies (AGC, DSKY, CDU,
    etc.), any of the drawings of the sub-assemblies of the
    sub-assemblies, and so on.<br>

    Note that the webpages for the individual G&amp;N configurations
    linked above are generated in an automated way which additionally
    outputs a JSON representation of the hierarchical assembly
    data.&nbsp; The JSON files are not provided on this website, but you
    can use the software to generate them for yourself, or to generate
    JSON for other assemblies (such as an AGC or a DSKY by
    itself).&nbsp; This is significant because it means that you can
    load this JSON into a program, perhaps written JavaScript or Python,
    and manipulate the assembly-hierarchy data programmatically.&nbsp;
    That would allow you to do things like compute total parts counts,
    perform failure-rate analyses, and so forth ... if you have any need
    whatever to do so!&nbsp; To generate such a JSON file, you will need
    to locally clone <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/schematics">the











      "schematics" branch of our GitHub software repository</a>.&nbsp;
    You will also need to have Python 3 installed.&nbsp; You generate
    the JSON for a given <tt><i>ASSEMBLY</i></tt> from a command line
    by changing into the DrawingTree/ folder and running the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldown.py <i>ASSEMBLY</i> &gt;</tt><tt><i>OUTPUT</i></tt><tt>.html</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    The <tt><i>ASSEMBLY</i></tt> name consists of a drawing number to
    which a configuration number is suffixed.&nbsp; The only allowed
    drawing numbers come from the names of the files
    DrawingTree/*.csv.&nbsp; The only allowed configuration numbers come
    from the "columns" of the .csv file (if you were, for example, to
    load it into a spreadsheet program).&nbsp; For example, the file
    2003200L.csv supports configuration numbers -011, -021, -031, -041,
    and -051, so you could generate JSON files for assemblies
    2003200-011 through 2003200-051.&nbsp; You are unlikely to want the
    output HTML file, and thus can discard it.&nbsp; The JSON is always
    output with the filename drilldown-<i>ASSEMBLY</i>.json.<br>
    <br>
    Additionally, the program drilldownCompare.py is provided.&nbsp; It
    can make comparisons of two assemblies for which JSON has already
    been generated.&nbsp; For example, to compare the guidance systems
    for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 LM, you would first generate their
    JSON<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldown 6014999-091 &gt;temp1.html</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>drilldown 6014999-071 &gt;temp2.html</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    and could then use the command<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldownCompare.py 6014999-091 6014999-071</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    You would find a number of differences in doing so, but perhaps the
    one that interested you most might be that assembly 2003993-031 (the
    AGC) had changed to 2003993-051.&nbsp; If you now wish to compare
    those two AGC assemblies, recall that you need to generate the JSON
    for them ... which is easy, but is a hassle.&nbsp; However, the data
    for assemblies 2003993-031 and -051 is already contained within the
    existing JSON for 6014999-091 and -071, respectively, so
    drilldownCompare.py lets you take a bit of a shortcut:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>drilldownCompare.py 6014999-091 6014999-071 </tt><tt>2003993-031











        2003993-051<br>

    These documents are theory-of-operation documents, which describe
    the circuits textually and often provide useful information like
    timing diagrams of what the circuits do.&nbsp; In the process of
    providing this info, though, they provide the schematics themselves
    as figured embedded within the text.&nbsp; In saying that the
    schematics provided in the theory-of-operation documents are
    "essentially complete", what I mean is that the schematics in these
    volumes aren't precisely in the form of the original drawings, but
    rather have been redrafted by AC Electronics to fit into the format
    of their volumes.&nbsp; Thus, they are subject to mistakes (and
    potentially, corrections) by AC Electronics, and cannot necessarily
    be straightforwardly matched to specific drawing numbers or
    revisions.<br>
    <br>
    Surprisingly, while we have schematics in one form or another for
    all AGC/DSKY modules, though not necessarily in all of the different
    forms or versions we like, and we have wiring diagrams for the DSKY
    backplane into which its modules are inserted, we do <i>not</i>
    have wiring diagrams for the AGC backplane.&nbsp; (See <a
      href="#Basic_Partitioning_of_the_AGC">this section</a> for a
    discussion of how the AGC circuitry is partitioned up.)&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, we do have enough information about it to be useful,
    compiled by two techniques:&nbsp; Firstly, the electrical schematics
    for the individual circuit modules list "net names" for all of the
    connector pins going from the module to the backplane, so we do know
    how the modules were interconnected on the backplane; secondly,
    physical AGCs can have their backplanes mapped by means of
    continuity checking with an ohmmeter.&nbsp; Mike Stewart has put
    together <a
      href="https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_hardware/blob/block2/delphi.db">a
      helpful sqlite database</a> and <a
      href="http://apolloguidance.computer/pins">an interactive, online
      form of it</a>, based on mapping out the backplane for AGC s/n 14.<br>

    <br>
    Besides the AGC Handbook, additional information used for
    cross-referencing the various drawings to specific AGC or DSKY part
    numbers and/or serial numbers came from a couple of sources:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Section 3.7 of the <a

          Labs Final Report on Contracts NAS9-153 and NAS9-4065</a> can
        be used to relate many AGC and DSKY serial numbers to the
        specific missions (or in some cases, other purposes) for which
        they were used.&nbsp; In some cases, there is a discrepancy
        between these two documents (e.g., which DSKYs were assigned to
        LM-10), in which case the latter document was chosen to be
        authoritative.<br>
      </li>
      <li>For Block I, <a

    <h1><a name="Versioning"></a>Versioning the AGC and DSKY<br>
    </h1>
    The AGC and DSKY part-numbering scheme looked like this:<br>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER-DASHNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, Block II AGCs had <i>PARTNUMBER</i>s 2003100,
      2003200, and 2003993, with <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s like -011, -021,
      -031, and so on.&nbsp; <i>REVISION</i>s were letter codes, such
      as A, B, C, etc., or else a dash (-) for "no revision".&nbsp; For
      example,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>2003200-011A<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Given a part number for a particular AGC (or DSKY) model, the
      part number then relates to a set of sub-assemblies (often
      represented by electrical schematics or mechanical drawings), many
      of which are circuit modules, which themselves may have varying
      versions over time, and have part-numbers like<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i>PARTNUMBER</i> <i>REVISION</i><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For example, the AGC with p/n 2003200-011A contained, among other
      things, an "oscillator module" which fit into a backplane socket
      labeled B7, and which itself had a p/n 2005003E ... and naturally,
      we have drawing 2005003E if you want to see it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In general, those <i>DASHNUMBER</i>s cover different
      configurations handled within the same engineering drawing.&nbsp;
      For example, drawing 2003100 might cover both configurations -011
      and -021, and you'd have to read the drawing itself to understand
      how unit 2003100-021 differs from unit 2003100-011.<br>
    </p>
    <p>With rare exceptions, different <i>REVISION</i>s of a drawing do
      not introduce any design changes within a specific configuration,
      but may be used to cumulatively add a new configuration.&nbsp; In
      other words, as long as a particular revision of a drawing
      contains the configuration you're interested in, it doesn't really
      matter (usually) that later revisions of a drawing may also exist,
      because later revisions won't differ substantively as far as any
      given configuration is concerned.<br>
    </p>
    <h1><a name="CAD_Files_and_Images"></a>CAD Files</h1>
    <p>In addition to providing scans of original electrical and
      mechanical drawings from the Apollo program, there is an ongoing
      effort to transcribe these drawings into CAD files.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Such CAD transcriptions are made as faithfully visually to the
      original as is feasible, given the capabilities of the CAD program
      involved, as long as there is no compromise of electrical or
      mechanical correctness.&nbsp; But realize that transcription is a
      human effort, so transcribed CAD files may at first contain
      errors; conversely, they may from time to time correct errors
      present in the original drawings — naturally, though, with
      suitable notes indicating that the change had been made, and
      why.&nbsp; It has also been possible occasionally to reconstruct
      some currently-missing drawings from the original Apollo Program.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Electrical_Drawings_"></a>Electrical Drawings<br>
    </h2>
    <p> </p>
    <p>As far as electrical CAD files are concerned, no community effort
      has developed to transcribe the electrical drawings into CAD, but
      it now appears as though one isn't really needed since I'm sure I
      can do them all myself ... eventually.&nbsp; You can simply treat
      the CAD files as resources which appeared from nowhere, but which
      you are free to use or modify for your own purposes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To do so, the open-source <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad
        electrical-design software</a> is used.&nbsp; It is available,
      for free of course, on Windows, Mac OS X, and all of the major
      flavors of Linux.&nbsp; The electrical schematics which have been
      transcribed into CAD, or are in the process of being transcribed,
      are stored in <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/schematics">the
"schematics"
















































        branch of our GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; Also they are
      typically rendered as PNG images as well, and <a href="KiCad/">provided















































        separately</a> for convenient browsing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There's plenty of online material to help you get started with
      KiCad, if you're inclined to do anything more with the CAD files
      as such.&nbsp; Here's the executive summary of what you need to
      know if you want to specifically work with our electrical
      schematics in KiCad:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's best to use the <i>nightly build</i> of KiCad (presently
        v6) rather than a stable version of it (presently v4 or v5), to
        stay as up-to-date as possible with respect to the bug reports
        we file.</li>
      <li>What you find in our GitHub repository for any given
        transcribed drawing is the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A folder called Schematics/<i>DRAWINGNUMBER</i>/ containing
          the files for the drawing.&nbsp; For example, the CAD files
          for drawing 2005912B are in Schematics/2005912B/.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A KiCad project file called module.pro, which you will need
          to open.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Once the project is open, you can run the schematic editor
          (eeschema) from KiCad's menu.&nbsp; The schematic page that
          opens up will <i>usually</i> look like 2 (or 1 or 3)
          rectangular blocks.&nbsp; Each of the rectangular blocks
          represents one of the original sheets of the drawing.&nbsp;
          Just double-click on one of the blocks to see the schematic
          for that page. <br>
        </li>
        <li>We use a grid size of 25 mils within the schematics.&nbsp;
          You should set the grid size to 25 mils and stay with it.</li>
        <li>Similarly, in the preferences, set the default line width to
          20 mils.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Many of the drawings consist largely of open-collector
          3-input NOR gates and oval-shaped pads, neither marked on the
          schematics with reference designators, so you may need to rely
          on notes within the schematic to know what's what.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>All of the symbol libraries for eeschema used in our CAD
        drawings are <i>custom</i> libraries, and no standard KiCad
        libraries are used.&nbsp; If you find that symbols are missing
        in the schematics you load, you'll have to maneuver through
        KiCad's menu system to individually enable all of the libraries
        needed.&nbsp; These are the *.lib files in the GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; There are a lot of them, primarily because of
        visual and power-supply variations the schematics need for the
        dual NOR-gate part; the main library, exclusive of the NOR
        gates, is AGC_DSKY.lib.</li>
      <li>You may also get warnings when loading a schematic about the
        library versions having changed and asking if you want to
        "recover" any symbols.&nbsp; The answer is that you do <i>not</i>
        want to recover any of them, which at the present time means you
        will need to uncheck the boxes next to every symbol it offers to
        recover for you.</li>
      <li>There's a lot of more-detailed information that may be useful
        in the repository's <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/schematics/README.md">README
















































          file</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Though no help in transcription is really needed, help in
      proof-reading and/or correcting the CAD files vs the original
      drawings is welcomed, and you can contact me directly at the
      address at the bottom of this page if you're interested.&nbsp;
      Just proof-reading doesn't actually require using CAD or even
      having expert electrical knowledge.&nbsp; It just involves
      comparing two images like the ones below and seeing how they
      differ from each other (click to enlarge):<br>

    <h2><a name="Mechanical_Drawings"></a>Mechanical Drawings</h2>
    <p>No mechanical drawings have yet been transcribed to CAD files
      (insofar as they fall officially under the aegis of the Virtual
      AGC project), so anything I have to say about it is somewhat
      theoretical.&nbsp; However, based on discussions with various
      parties interested in the topic and/or currently working on the
      problem for their own benefit, here is the guidance I can offer
      you so far.<br>
    </p>
    <p>First, there isn't likely to be any concerted effort to
      transcribe the AGC/DSKY mechanical drawings into 2D CAD form,
      although doing so would be consistent with the efforts we've made
      with transcription of AGC software source code and AGC/DSKY
      electrical drawings.&nbsp; There are simply so many such
      mechanical drawings (over 4000 scans at this writing) ... plus,
      the mechanical-engineering community has really moved past 2D
      design anyway, if my understanding of what I've been told is
      correct.&nbsp; If you would like to make some 2D CAD
      transcriptions of the mechanical drawings, though, I am happy to
      accept them for inclusion in the collection.&nbsp; I would ask
      that submissions conform to the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 2D CAD files should be mechanically accurate.</li>
      <li>If changes to the original design have been made to correct
        errors in the original drawing (or for any other reason), you
        should add notes to the CAD drawing explaining what has
        happened, and why, when, and who made the change.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The files should be in DXF format.</li>
      <li>The file naming should conform to the original Apollo drawing
        number and revision.&nbsp; In other words, if you have
        transcribed drawing 1234567A, it should be named 1234567A.dxf.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The files should be importable by <a
          href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD open-source design
          software</a>, and should be visually accurate with respect to
        the original drawings, insofar as that is feasible, after being
        so imported.</li>
    </ul>
    But instead of 2D drawings, the main thing in which people seem to
    be interested is the creation of reusable 3D models of the various
    fabricated parts comprising the AGC and/or DSKY.&nbsp; If you wish
    to make submissions of that type, they should conform to the
    following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The 3D models can be of two types:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Models that faithfully duplicate the original mechanical
          design.&nbsp; (Preferred.)</li>
        <li>Models that modify the original mechanical design to handle
          changed requirements, such as making parts thicker so that
          they can be 3D printed in plastic rather than cast in
          metal.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>If changes to the design have been made to correct errors in
        the original drawing (or for any other reason), you should add
        notes to the model explaining what has happened, and why, when,
        and who made the change. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The files should be in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21">STEP format</a>.</li>
      <li>The files should conform to the original Apollo drawing number
        and revision.&nbsp; In other words, if you have transcribed
        drawing 1234567A, and if it is a <i>faithful</i> transcription,
        it should be named 1234567A.stp.&nbsp; If it is a <i>modified</i>
        transcription, then the name would be something like 1234567A-<i>ExtraDescriptionOfChanges</i>.stp.&nbsp;
(I'd
















































        also personally prefer that filenames don't contain spaces,
        though hyphens and underlines are okay.)&nbsp; Files with
        extensive changes or other documentation needs can be
        accompanied by a README.md file, in "markdown" format, in which
        case the files would together occupy their own dedicated folder
        in the repository.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The files should be importable by <a
          href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD open-source design
          software</a>.</li>

    <p>Each of these modules has an associated drawing.&nbsp; For
      example, in the 2003200-011 AGC, module A1 (the "scaler" module)
      has electrical drawing 2005259A.&nbsp; In other words, each module
      is considered to comprise a single circuit, with a unique (though
      possibly multi-sheet) drawing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Modules A1 - A24 consist entirely of "logic": i.e., their
      electrical drawings consist entirely of NOR-gates and the
      connectors for plugging the modules into the
      backplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, I suppose, the
      drawings aren't called "schematics", but are often given the
      special name "LOGIC FLOW DIAGRAMS".&nbsp; But they're schematics
      anyway.&nbsp; Modules A25 - A31 and B1 - B17 are entirely analog
      in nature and are specifically called "SCHEMATICS".<br>
    </p>
    <p>As far as the construction of the circuitry is concerned, three
      basic techniques were intermixed:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logic-flow module (A1 - A24) construction changed over time:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Early 2003100 AGCs: The components of a module were
          partitioned into 4 "quadrants", and the components of each
          quadrant were mounted on a multilayer nickel ribbon.&nbsp; The
          4 ribbons themselves were also interconnected at various
          strategic spots.&nbsp; This design proved not to work properly
          because of excessive interconnection delays due to the
          properties of the ribbon, though as far as I know, the design
          was basically sound in other respects and should still work if
          a better interconnection technique is used.&nbsp; The picture
          below is of a logic module with just such a nickel ribbon<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>2003993, 2003200, and later 2003100 AGCs: Each module
          contains two multilayer circuit boards, though I've chosen to
          show you only one of them in the image below.&nbsp; We'd see
          the other one if we flipped the module over.<br>

    <ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Analog modules (A25 - A29, B1 - B17):&nbsp; These used
        so-called "welded cordwood" construction.&nbsp; What that means
        is that you have a metal block with holes in it, like Swiss
        cheese; the components (such as resistors, capacitors,
        transistors, etc.) are inserted into the holes in the block,
        with their leads protruding from either side.&nbsp; Wires are
        then welded (not soldered) to the leads to interconnect the
        components.&nbsp; In the image below, note the nifty insert
        providing reference designators for the components.<br>
      </li>

    <p>Of course, these details don't matter much in modern terms unless
      you're <i>very</i> enthusiastic about building an AGC re-creation
      and want to do it absolutely 100% authentically.&nbsp; If you
      were, you would be defeated in the end by the fact that the
      electronic components originally used, such as the dual
      triple-input NOR gates, are no longer available in precisely the
      form they were originally used.&nbsp; And while I haven't priced
      ferrite memory lately, I expect that it's probably not terribly
      cost-effective.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16"
        height="16">&nbsp; Though, surprisingly, you can get junked
      ferrite-memory systems from eBay; not from the AGC, naturally, but
      perhaps close enough that they could be made to work if mined for
      parts.<br>

      II AGC p/n 2003100-021</h1>
    <p>This is an interesting version of the AGC, in that the logic
      circuitry was constructed in a very different fashion than later
      dash numbers of 2003100 (and the later versions 2003200 and
      2003993) were.&nbsp; Those later versions used multi-layer printed
      circuit boards to hold the integrated circuits, whereas <i>this</i>
      version interconnected them via a nickel ribbon.&nbsp; <a
        href="Documents/HSI-25007.pdf">The nickel-ribbon design turned
        out to have too much capacitance, resulting in excessive signal
        delay, and the design didn't function in practice</a>.&nbsp;
      This is what resulted in the introduction of multi-layer printed
      circuit boards instead.&nbsp; That's not to say, of course, that
      there's anything wrong with the electrical schematics for this
      design, since the physical construction of the circuitry is
      basically outside the scope of the electrical schematics.&nbsp;
      I'm told that all existing functional 2003100 AGC units are of the
      multi-layer printed-circuit variety.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the nickel-ribbon interconnect, the circuitry for
      the various modules was actually divided into four separate
      "quadrants" of circuitry, which were mostly rather independent but
      did have some interaction with each other.&nbsp; Later designs
      removed the concept of quadrants altogether.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Besides <a href="#Sources_of_Information">the reference sources</a>
      mentioned earlier, <a href="Documents/apollolunarexcuracel_1.pdf">AC
Electronics
















































        document ND-1021043 of March 10, 1966</a>, supposedly relates to
      AGC p/n 2003100-021 (according to its Tables 3-I and 7-I), and its
      Table 8-II lists all of the associated module drawings.&nbsp; But
      I don't believe there are any differences between the circuitry it
      presents and that presented by ND-1021042.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, there's the question of "signal wiring diagrams".&nbsp;
      These are related to the nickel-ribbon interconnect described
      above. To understand what that is and how to read one, consult the
      <a href="#Appendix:_Signal_Wiring_Diagrams">Appendix</a>.&nbsp; It
      should be noted that because of the later reworking of the design
      to replace the nickel-ribbon interconnect with a multi-layer
      printed circuit board, the reference designators and pin numbering
      from later versions is not closely related to numbering of this
      version of the design.<br>

    <h1><a name="PartNumbers"></a>Appendix: Evolution of Block II AGC
      Part Numbers</h1>
    The way different part numbers of AGCs (or DSKYs) are related to one
    another is that you start with a given assembly with a certain part
    number (such as Block II AGC with p/n 2003100-011), then you apply
    an Engineering Change Proposal, or ECP for short, such as ECP 322
    (described as "computer wiring changes"), with the result that you
    now have a different assembly p/n 2003100-021.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The list below shows how all known Block II AGC part numbers are
    interrelated according to the principle just mentioned.&nbsp; Many
    of these changes clearly are not electrical in nature, or else refer
    to intermediate or test versions of the AGC.&nbsp; Sometimes there
    are multiple paths to get to the same part number, if the ECPs are
    applied in different orders.&nbsp; For example, p/n 2003993-061 +
    ECP 815 = p/n 2003993-071 + ECP 719 = p/n 2003993-111.&nbsp; I've
    only bothered to show one such path below in the few cases where
    that happens.<br>

    We don't have an official document, in so far as I am aware, giving
    the Instrumentation Lab's part numbers for electronics components
    like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and so on.&nbsp; Many of
    them are deducible from other documents, like the AGC Handbook
    drawings.&nbsp; For example, from drawing 2005952-, we can find out
    that part number 1006750-32 is a 1/4W 1K resistor with a 2%
    tolerance, while part number 1010406-7 is an 8.2 μH 10% tolerance
    R.F. coil.&nbsp; Mike Stewart (thanks, Mike!) has done a lot of that
    for us, but the task is still incomplete.<br>

    The list above may not be <i>fully</i> up-to-date with respect to
    the master list, which is actually <a

our
















































      GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; If you have corrections or additions
    to this table, I believe you can edit the table directly in GitHub,
    though your changes won't go live unless we approve them.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the raw list of part numbers above, we have the
    Specification Control Drawings (SCDs) for most of them.&nbsp; In
    modern terms you can think of the SCD as being like the data sheets
    for the components, except that instead of being written by the
    manufacturers, they are Instrumentation Lab drawings, and serve
    roughly the same purpose.&nbsp; We have most of the SCDs in multiple
    revisions, so if you're interested in that kind of thing, you can
    see how the specifications evolved over time.&nbsp; If you want to
    see them, look on <a href="AgcDrawingIndex.html">our AGC

      Wiring Diagrams for the Block II AGC 2003100 and the NOR-Gate
      Problem<br>

        align="right">First, an elementary introductory digression, for
      anyone who isn't an electronics expert but has persevered in
      reading to this point.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When designing electronic circuitry, it is customary to assign
      each electrical component in the circuit a unique "reference
      designator" (or "refd", pronounced REF-DEE, for short), and to
      refer to the components by those refd's.&nbsp; The refd's can be
      anything, but customarily they consist of a letter to indicate the
      general type of component — R for resistors, C for capacitors, D
      (or perhaps CR) for diodes, and so on — followed by a number to
      indicate which specific component it is within the circuit.&nbsp;
      For example, in the typical kind of circuit diagram shown to the
      right, you see resistors R1 through R7, capacitor C3, transistors
      Q1 through Q3, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Integrated circuits (IC's) typically have U as the alphabetical
      prefix, thus you might have integrated circuits U1, U2, U3, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>One thing that happens sometimes is that a given component might
      actually be a conveniently packaged-together collection of <i>several</i>
      essentially interchangeable simpler parts.&nbsp; For example, a
      "dual NOR gate" integrated circuit would be a device that provides
      two separate NOR gates, which are independent of each other but
      are packaged together to save space or cost or for some other
      reason of convenience.&nbsp; When that happens, the overall
      integrated circuit still has a U-based refd, perhaps U3, but the
      two NOR-gates comprising it each have refd's of their own, which
      would normally be U3A and U3B.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="SenseAmplifierCircuit.jpg" alt="" width="541"
        height="393" align="right">The example of a NOR-gate wasn't
      chosen arbitrarily. In fact, since integrated circuits were a
      pretty new development during the early Apollo Program, and were
      still suspiciously unreliable and quite expensive, the AGC
      circuitry originally didn't use any of them.&nbsp; Eventually,
      though, the relentless pressure to miniaturize forced integrated
      circuits into the design.&nbsp; As it happens, the AGC ended up
      using a single type of integrated circuit (the DSKY used none at
      all), though it used <i>lots</i> of them.&nbsp; As you've
      probably guessed, that one type of IC was in fact a dual
      triple-input NOR gate.<br>
    </p>
    <p>(Actually, that's a bit of an over-simplification, though it's
      largely true for our purposes.&nbsp; In fact, the Block II AGC
      used dual NOR gate integrated circuits, as stated, but the Block I
      AGC used integrated circuits containing a single NOR-gate
      each.&nbsp; Besides that, the sense amplifier modules used
      comparatively small numbers of sense-amplifier integrated
      circuits, whose internal composition is depicted in the figure to
      the right.&nbsp; The sense amplifier integrated circuit was
      exactly as complex as a dual triple-input NOR gate integrated IC,
      in that each of them contained 6 NPN transistors and 8 resistors
      ... which is just an interesting factoid and is neither here nor
      there.&nbsp; For the purposes of our present discussion, neither
      the Block I NOR gates nor the sense-amplifier ICs are of any
      relevance whatever.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>I won't bore you by telling you about the general properties of
      NOR gates, but to understand the discussion in this section you do
      need to know a couple of different things about them.&nbsp;
      Firstly, in the AGC schematics a NOR gate is symbolized either as<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="NORgates.png" width="244"
        height="43"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="left">and secondly, all of the three inputs of a NOR
      gate are interchangeable, in the sense that if you swapped any two
      of them, the behavior of the device would remain the same. (I
      suppose it may also be worth noting that of the two NOR-gate
      representations above, you can have two of the left-hand kind as
      the A and B parts of a dual NOR gate, or two of the right-hand
      kind, but not one of each.)<br>
      <br>
      What this is all leading up to is that some of the early AGC (p/n
      2003100 only) electrical schematic drawings:<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Do not list any ref's for NOR-gates, so we have no way of
          knowing from the schematics which individual NOR gate is
          packaged with any other into a dual-NOR IC; and</li>
        <li>Do not list any pin numbers for the NOR-gate inputs, so we
          have know way of knowing which of the interchangeable inputs
          any given input signal is hooked up to.</li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left"><img alt="" src="numberedSchematic.png"
          width="474" height="247" align="right"></div>
      <p>To get a sense of this, to the right there are two versions of
        a sample (nonsense) circuit consisting of NOR gates, one with
        refd's and pin numbers, and one without.&nbsp; In the right-hand
        version, we know, for example, that pin U1A-J is connected to
        pins U1B-F, U2A-F, and U2B-F.&nbsp; In the left-hand version we
        know that the output from one NOR gate is connected to some
        input or other on each of the other NOR gates.&nbsp; Imagine
        trying to repair or discuss the left-hand version!<br>
      </p>
      <p>As far as the operation of the circuit is concerned, of course,
        it makes no difference at all whether or not those refd's or pin
        numbers are there, because all of the NOR gates are
        interchangeable and all of the inputs to them are
        interchangeable, so the OUTPUT we get from any given INPUT is
        still exactly the same.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the same way, you personally may not care one way or the
        other which specific NOR gate is used for any given purpose in
        the AGC circuitry, nor may you care which input pin is which on
        those NOR gates.&nbsp; If that's so, you don't need to read any
        further ... just go back to looking at the schematics presented
        above on this page and enjoy!<br>
      </p>
      <p>But the truth is that the original AGC developers did care
        which NOR gate was which and what pin number was what ... it's
        just that for some reason they didn't find it convenient to put
        that information directly into some of the schematic diagrams
        for AGC p/n 2003100, and hence they chose to provide it through
        some other mechanism.&nbsp; That mechanism is the so-called
        "signal wiring diagram", and each of the schematic drawings in
        the AGC 2003100 containing NOR gates had an associated signal
        wiring diagram.&nbsp; Below, there's a "typical" (actually,
        slightly more legible than usual) portion of a signal wiring
        diagram:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="typicalSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>You may be forgiven for thinking that this makes the situation
        even more confusing to deal with, particularly since you are
        quite correct about it, but it helps if you know how to read
        it!&nbsp; When you know how to read it, it tells you which
        NOR-gates are paired into which in the dual NOR-gate IC's, which
        of the pair is the "A" member of the duet and which is the "B"
        member, and which pin numbers the signals are hooked up to.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It doesn't tell you exactly how to specify the refd's of the
        dual-NOR IC's, but we know from other versions of the AGC
        roughly how they did that, so we'll talk about that later.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first thing to notice is that one side of the diagram is
        marked as LEFT and the other as RIGHT.&nbsp; In this drawing,
        LEFT is at the bottom and RIGHT is at the top, but in other
        drawings that's reversed, so try to think only of LEFT and RIGHT
        instead of bottom and top.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Next, notice the little numbers written along the LEFT or
        bottom edge (39155, 39145, 39149, ...) and RIGHT or top edge
        (39156, 19151, 39152, ...).&nbsp; Those numbers are actually
        written on the NOR gates in the schematics, in lieu of refd's,
        and each individual NOR gate is identified uniquely by these
        numbers.&nbsp; These are called "gate numbers".&nbsp; So, a pair
        of such gate numbers could uniquely specify a dual-NOR
        gate.&nbsp; The RIGHT numbers are the "A" NOR gates, and the
        numbers opposite them on the LEFT are the associated "B" NOR
        gates within the same dual NOR IC.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Before talking about the other stuff written on the diagram,
        let's talk a little more about the dual-NOR ICs.&nbsp; The AGC's
        were 10-pin rectangular packages, with the pins on them
        variously labeled either numerically or alphabetically,
        depending on the purpose of the discussion.&nbsp; We might draw
        it like so, with the "A" NOR gate on the left and the "B" NOR
        gate on the right:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="dualNOR.png" width="311"
          height="299"></div>
      <p><br>
        Ignore the fact that the NOR gates now look like little rocket
        ships; that may or may not be significant.&nbsp; Rather, the
        important things to note are that there are VCC and GND inputs
        to power the device, that the "A" gate has pins 1-4 (or J, A, B,
        C), and that the "B" gate has pins 6-9 (or D, E, F, K).<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you look along the bottom (LEFT) edge of the signal wiring
        diagram, you'll see a repeating pattern (from left to right)
        consisting of<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>a small square</li>
        <li>an even smaller circle</li>
        <li>3 empty spots</li>
        <li>an oval with a number inside </li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left">What those represent in terms of the dual-NOR IC
        are:<br>
        <div align="center">
          <div align="left">
            <ol>
              <li>pin 10 of the dual-NOR</li>
              <li>pin 9</li>
              <li>pins 8, 7, and 6<br>
              </li>
              <li>a spot unrelated to the NOR</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div align="left">Similarly, along the top (RIGHT) edge of the
            signal wiring diagram, you'll see a similar but slightly
            less regular pattern of 6 positions:<br>
          </div>
          <div align="left">
            <div align="center">
              <div align="left">
                <ol>
                  <li>small circle</li>
                  <li>3 empty spots</li>
                  <li>2 spots with several possible markings</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div align="left">And in terms of the dual-NORs, these
                are:<br>
              </div>
              <div align="left">
                <div align="center">
                  <div align="left">
                    <ol>
                      <li>pin 1 of the dual-NOR</li>
                      <li>pins 2, 3, and 4</li>
                      <li>2 other things not related to the NOR.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <div align="left">We'll get to what those non-NOR
                    things are later, but the point to understand right
                    now is that 9 of each dual-NOR's 10 pins appear in a
                    regular manner along these edges.&nbsp; (The 10th
                    pin is always grounded, and we won't worry ourselves
                    about it.)<br>
                  </div>
                  <div align="left"> <br>
                    What about those weird, snake-like horizontal lines
                    running lengthwise along the middle of the signal
                    wiring diagram?&nbsp; Wires!&nbsp; Where the wire
                    points downward, there's a connection along the
                    bottom edge of the diagram, whereas when it points
                    upward there's a connection along the top edge of
                    the diagram.&nbsp; In the image below, I've added
                    some false coloring to just one of those snakelike
                    lines to focus the attention on it:<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="coloredSignalWiringDiagram.jpg" width="1328" height="645"></div>
      <p>So according to the description I just gave, the wire makes a
        connection to the following:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39155, pin 9 (output of a "B" NOR gate)</li>
        <li>NOR-gate at location 39107, pin 9 (output of a different "B"
          NOR gate)</li>
        <li>An oval with a <i>very</i> smudgy 111 written in it.&nbsp;
          Maybe.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, if you know anything about electronics, you may be worried
        that the outputs of two different NOR gates are tied
        together.&nbsp; Don't worry, though, these NOR-gates have
        open-collector outputs (or more precisely, open-collector with a
        pullup resistor to VCC), and so they can be tied together to
        increase their drive capacity (or to effectively increase the
        number of NOR inputs for a single output) without any problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps I should finally say what some of these non-NOR
        markings along the edges are:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A numbered oval is a pin on the connector from the circuit
          to the AGC's backplane.&nbsp; In other words, a signal leaving
          or entering the circuit.</li>
        <li>A pointed box like &lt;VCC&gt; or &lt;0V&gt; is a
          power-supply or ground connection.</li>
        <li>A rectangular box with an alphanumeric label inside of it is
          an "inter-quadrant" connection, and we'll get to that in a
          moment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At any rate, the point is that this red wire represents two
        NOR-gates tied together to drive connector pin 111.&nbsp; Now, I
        didn't mention it before, but this signal wiring diagram happens
        to be from <a href="AGCHandbook/A5-2005061D-1.jpg">sheet 1 of
          drawing 2005061D</a>, and if we look at that drawing, we will
        indeed find that connector pin 111 is being driven by NOR gates
        39107 and 39155.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What is this "inter-quadrant" thing of which I spoke, and for
        that matter, what is a "quadrant" anyway?<br>
      </p>
      <p>For these AGC modules, the connector from the module to the AGC
        backplane has 4 rows of 69 pins each (numbered 1 to 71, but with
        21 and 51 missing).&nbsp; Each one of those rows of pins
        essentially has its own circuit associated with it, and these
        separate circuits are called "quadrants".&nbsp; The concept of
        the "quadrant" was used only for early dash numbers of the
        2003100 AGC (such as the one we have schematics for!), and
        disappeared for later 2003100 versions, and for the 2003200 and
        2003993 AGC's, though much of the numbering of components on the
        schematics remains tied to the quadrant concept even if the
        quadrants themselves disappeared.<br>
      </p>
      <p>By "separate circuits", I mean logically separate rather than
        physically separated onto different circuit boards, though
        apparently that was originally what was tried.&nbsp; And
        usually, the circuitry on the quadrants isn't <i>entirely</i>
        logically independent of the circuitry on the other quadrants,
        and in that case there have to be one or more electrical
        connections between the quadrants of the module ... i.e.,
        inter-quadrant connections.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In fact, the signal wiring diagram I've been showing you isn't
        the complete diagram for drawing 2005061D, but simply the signal
        wiring diagram for quadrant 1 of 2005061D.&nbsp; There are three
        other quadrants, and therefore 3 other signal wiring diagrams
        for this module as well.&nbsp; Most modules have a complete
        complement of 4 quadrants, and thus have 4 signal wiring
        diagrams associated with them.&nbsp; But some modules have less
        quadrants and therefore less signal wiring diagrams.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So now all of the questions are answered except for
        refd's.&nbsp; For that, I want to direct your attention just
        above the row of gate numbers at the bottom edge of the signal
        wiring diagram shown above, or just below the row of gate
        numbers along the top edge.&nbsp; You'll see a row of tiny, tiny
        numbers going from 1 (at the left) to 180 (at the right)
        there.&nbsp; Or more accurately, you'll see rows of tiny smudges
        that may or may not be numbers, but you can still see that there
        are 180 of them.&nbsp; Let's call these things "smudge numbers",
        for lack of a better term.&nbsp; The IC's are numbered
        sequentially, starting at the end with the larger smudge
        numbers, where we find U01, and moving toward the end with the
        smaller smudge numbers, where we find U30.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, there's some subtlety involve here.&nbsp; For
        example, what happens if there's an open space, as there is in
        our pictured signal wiring diagram at U23?&nbsp; Should we just
        skip U23 in our numbering altogether, or should the next
        position become U23 rather than U24?&nbsp; You could argue it
        either way, but I'd vote for skipping U23 altogether, because it
        helps preserve IC numbering across different hardware
        versions.&nbsp; In other words, if a dual-NOR is removed or
        added, it won't necessarily cause all of the refd's for the <i>other</i>
        dual-NORs to change.&nbsp; But truthfully, we don't actually
        know what the original designers did in this regard.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another subtlety in the IC numbering is the quadrants:&nbsp;
        The entire circuit module consists of 4 quadrants, and if we
        followed the scheme just described, there would be 4 IC's
        labeled U01, 4 labeled U02, and so on.&nbsp; Not good!&nbsp; So
        in our CAD work we actually prefix the quadrant numbers to the
        IC numbering.&nbsp; In other words, in quadrant 1, the IC's run
        from U101 up to U130; in quadrant 2, the IC's run from U201 up
        to U230; etc.&nbsp; Thus every IC ends up with a unique number
        within the module, and we can still use that number to precisely
        identify where it is located physically.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And finally, one last subtlety:&nbsp; Some of the quadrants
        have signal wiring diagrams as shown, with LEFT on the bottom,
        RIGHT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from left to
        right.&nbsp; Other quadrants are reversed, with RIGHT on the
        bottom, LEFT on the top, and smudge numbers increasing from
        right to left.&nbsp; My descriptions above are all still
        correct, as long as you keep thinking of LEFT and RIGHT and
        ordering of smudge numbers as I've urged, rather than thinking
        of the top, bottom, right, and left edges of the signal wiring
        diagram as you might otherwise be inclined to do.&nbsp; The
        reason for this reversal seems to have to do with some of the
        quadrants being on the <i>front</i> side, and some being on the
        <i>back</i> side, with the numbering consequently mirror imaged.<br>

        Wiring Diagrams and the Block I AGC</h1>

          align="left"><img src="NOR-TO-47-diag.jpg" alt="" width="464"
          height="491" align="right">For the Block I AGC, problems
        similar to those described in the preceding section exist,
        though the problems and solutions are different in detail.&nbsp;
        In fact, read the preceding section before reading this one so
        that you can have some background for the discussion in this
        section!<br>
      </p>
      <p>One problem that can thankfully be ignored in the Block I AGC
        is that the NOR-gate integrated circuit contains a single
        triple-input NOR gate, packaged in a TO-47 can, rather than two
        independent NOR gates packaged together in a flatpack, as in the
        Block II AGC.&nbsp; That simplifies a lot.&nbsp; You can see
        both a photo of such a gate (to the left) and a diagram
        elucidating its pinout and internal circuit (to the right).<br>
      </p>
      <p>A problem the Block I "logic flow diagrams" (schematics
        containing NOR gates) have that the Block II doesn't have, is
        that there were apparently multiple hardware generations of the
        Block I AGC that were mechanically quite different.&nbsp; In
        particular, both the backplane-connector pin numbers and the
        means for identifying the NOR-gate components differed from one
        hardware generation to the next.&nbsp; The schematic diagrams,
        meanwhile, showed the connector pin numbers and gate
        identification for multiple hardware generations, thus making
        them a tad more confusing than they might have been otherwise.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We don't actually know much about these different hardware
        generations, but here's our current thinking on the
        subject.&nbsp; We think there were three separate Block I AGC
        hardware generations, which <i>may</i> have differed as
        follows:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "AGC 4" generation:&nbsp; Might have been a rack-mount
          computer.&nbsp; I.e., not of a similar size or shape to flight
          models.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The "AGC 4B" generation:&nbsp; Might have been the first
          with integrated circuits, as opposed to NOR gates constructed
          from discrete transistors and resistors as in the diagram to
          the right (which represents the internal structure of the NOR
          integrated circuit).&nbsp; Using integrated circuits would
          have miniaturized the circuit.&nbsp; The substitution doesn't
          affect functionality, so we'd expect software written for the
          one generation to execute properly on the other generation.</li>
        <li>The "AGC 5" generation:&nbsp; Might have been constructed
          more-or-less the same was as the flight computers were.&nbsp;
          I.e., in a similar form factor.</li>

        align="left">For example, in the tiny excerpt from one of the
      Block I electrical schematics to the left, consider the NOR gate
      with the markings "2G5" and "65129".&nbsp; "2G5" was how the gate
      was identified in generation "AGC 4", while "65129" was how it was
      identified in generation "AGC 5", according to the notes (not
      shown) written in the schematic itself.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Similarly, consider the connector pin for the
        backplane signal "MPO".&nbsp; It is marked both as pin #94 and
        as pin #104. The former is for AGC 4, while the latter is for
        AGC 5.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      However, the Block I AGC schematics have the same characteristics
      as the early Block II schematics, in the sense that they do not
      display pin numbers for the (interchangeable) <i> inputs</i> of
      the NOR gates, nor do they indicate what we would think of as
      reference designators for the NOR gates.&nbsp; Of course, since
      there's was a single NOR gate per integrated circuit, the
      gate-number markings (like "2G5" or "65129) could basically serve
      double-duty as reference designators, and having a separate
      reference designator doesn't really serve much purpose, so perhaps
      there weren't any at all.&nbsp; Plus, each of the NOR gates in the
      example to the left has a single input ... but from the figure
      above, we know that pins 1, 3, and 5 of the NOR gate were all
      interchangeable, so which input is the one being used?&nbsp; They
      probably are <i>not</i> all the "middle" pin, pin #3, since that
      wouldn't always have been the pin it was most convenient to
      physically route a wire to.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      At any rate, since the schematic doesn't have this kind of info in
      it, the information has to come from somewhere else.&nbsp; It must
      instead be deduced instead from the so-called "wiring
      diagrams".&nbsp; These Block I wiring diagrams, however, though
      quite similar in concept were quite different in detail from the
      Block II signal wiring diagrams described in the preceding
      section.&nbsp; The image below is a wiring diagram for the Block I
      "scaler" module, otherwise known as AGC modules A33 and A34.&nbsp;
      (Identical modules were plugged into slots A33 and A34.)&nbsp; The
      wiring diagram itself is drawing 1006127A, while the corresponding
      electrical schematic drawing is 1006547G.&nbsp; The original
      drawing was in black&amp;white (at least, by the time <i>we</i>
      got it), but I've added various color notations to it for the
      purpose of this discussion.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><a
          href="BlockIWiringDiagram-1006127A-annotated.jpg"><img

      <br>
      Perhaps the first thing to note is that there are two separate
      circuits in this wiring diagram.&nbsp; There's the "even" half,
      depicted on the left-hand side of this diagram, consisting of the
      columns labeled<br>
      <div align="center">&nbsp;<img src="wd1-6.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36"> &nbsp; <img src="wd1-2.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36">&nbsp; <img src="wd1-4.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36"><br>
      </div>
      and the "odd" half (the right-hand side of the diagram), with
      columns labeled<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-5.png" alt="" width="37"
          height="36">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="wd1-3.png" alt=""
          width="37" height="36">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="wd1-7.png"
          alt="" width="37" height="36"><br>
      </div>
      Of those, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are intended to represent the
      front sides of the circuits, while <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>5</b>,
      and <b>7</b> (being mirror imaged) represent the back side of the
      circuits.<br>
      <br>
      These two halves are independent of each other, in the sense that
      the only electrical connections between the two are via the
      backplane.&nbsp; In other words, if you wanted to connect a signal
      in the left half of the circuit to one in the right half, the
      signal would have to go out through the module's connector, onto
      the AGC backplane, then back up into a different pin on the
      module's backplane connector.&nbsp; There is a 142-pin connector
      (two rows of 71 pins each) to the backplane, with the the even
      half of the circuit using the even-numbered pins and the odd half
      using the odd-numbered pins, and in the diagram the connector pins
      are also depicted as circled numbers like<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-connectorpins.jpg" alt=""
          width="39" height="131"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Each the two halves has 60 NOR gates, labeled in the diagram both
      by a "CIRCUIT NUMBER" and a "POSITION NUMBER", and are depicted in
      the diagram as objects like<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-normal.png" alt="" width="43"
          height="42">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp; <img
          src="wd1-expander.png" alt="" width="43" height="42"><br>
      </div>
      <p>The former are the normal NOR gates, while the latter are the
        so-called "expander" or "fan-in" NOR gates, represented in the
        electrical schematics by the following two symbols,
        respectively:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img alt="" src="NORgates.png" width="244"
          height="43"></p>
      <p>As you can see, each of these NOR gates has 4 signals, as it is
        supposed to, with the open circle being the output and the solid
        circles being the three inputs.&nbsp; As as far as <i>which</i>
        of the filled-in black circles represent <i>which</i> inputs to
        the NOR gates, we don't actually have enough information about
        how the wiring diagrams are interpreted to be able to
        tell.&nbsp; On the basis of the fact that these circular objects
        visually represent the bottom side of the NOR-gate TO-47 cans
        (see the figure at the top right of this section), my
        interpretation would be:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-pinout.jpg" alt="" width="110"
          height="120"></div>
      <p>Of course, a mirror image of this arrangement, or indeed any
        other permutation of pins 1, 2, and 3 would logically be equally
        possible.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Note too that some or all of the NOR-gate pins have solid black
        lines going to them, and of course these represent the
        wires.&nbsp; All of the fat, solid, black lines in the wiring
        diagram are wires.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The final factoid needed to interpret the diagram is to note
        that each of the circuit halves seems to have wires that exit to
        the left or to the right, and then just stop in mid-air, so to
        speak, without actually connecting to anything. Notice, however,
        that the wires exiting to the left and the right are exactly
        paired with each other: for each wire exiting to the left,
        there's one at the exact same position vertically exiting to the
        right.&nbsp; This is intended to mean that those two dangling
        wires are connected together as the same signal.&nbsp; I've
        added a couple of blue lines to the diagram to make this point
        graphically.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, to avoid being misleading, I should admit that it's a
        little trickier than this sometimes.&nbsp; The true is that
        there's not <i>necessarily</i> a unique match between the
        dangling wires exiting to the left and those to the right, so
        sometimes you have to work it out using the schematic as a
        reference.&nbsp; The figure below is an excerpt from a different
        signal-wiring diagram that shows this ambiguity.&nbsp; I can't
        really give you any advice on resolving such ambiguities, other
        than to say that if you trace through the wires, you'll
        (hopefully always) find that one of the possible connections
        makes no sense with respect to the associated schematic, and
        that the other one does.<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="BlockIWiringDiagram-1006127A-ambiguous.jpg" width="786"
          height="71"></div>
      <p>Ignoring complications like that, which are fortunately in the
        minority, let's work out an example in detail.&nbsp; Consider
        the NOR-gate with CIRCUIT NUMBER "--039" at POSITION NUMBER "02"
        at the upper left of the wiring diagram.&nbsp; (You'll have to
        click on the wiring diagram image shown earlier to expand it, in
        order to understand the description below.)&nbsp; In the wiring
        diagram, we see that:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The output of --039, pin 7, exits to the left, where it
          wraps around and connects to a corresponding wire dangling at
          the right, and eventually ends up at connector pin 02.</li>
        <li> Input pin 1 of --039 comes from a signal that comes from or
          goes to the following places:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Output pin 7 of NOR gate --035.</li>
          <li>Input pin 1 of NOR gate --037.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>So ... how well does this correspond to what the corresponding
        electrical schematic drawing, <a
          href="https://archive.org/stream/BlockISchematics#page/n143/mode/1up">1006547G</a>,
        says is supposed to be happening?&nbsp; Well, wonder no
        more!&nbsp; Here's the relevant excerpt from the schematic, and
        as you can see, it is exactly as our interpretation of the
        wiring diagram says it ought to be:<br>
      </p>
      <div align="center"><img src="wd1-example.jpg" alt="" width="1061"
          height="195"><br>
        <div align="left"><br>
          But finally, a word of caution:&nbsp; The match between
          electrical schematics and their associated signal wiring
          diagrams is not always as perfect as the explanation above
          implies.&nbsp; Of course, the Apollo Program preceded the
          availability of computerized CAD systems which could have
          automatically generated error-free signal wiring diagrams (if
          they were even needed at all!) directly from the
          schematics.&nbsp; In other words, both the schematics and the
          wiring diagrams had to be separately, manually drawn ...
          naturally, we'd expect occasional errors just on that
          account.&nbsp; But it's somewhat worse than that.&nbsp;
          Consider the example we've been using, namely schematic
          1006547 and associated wiring diagram 1006127.&nbsp; This
          block of circuitry has NOR-gates labeled "--000" through
          "--079", plus additional NOR gates in the range "--301" and
          above.&nbsp; The schematic and wiring diagram match perfectly
          for the range 000-079, but <i>completely differ </i>for the
          range 301+, as if completely different circuits were being
          described by the schematic and the wiring diagram.&nbsp; And
          that may indeed be what happened, since the wiring diagram was
          drawn in February 1963, some three months prior to the
          schematic in May 1963. Possibly there had been second thoughts
          about the partitioning of the circuitry into modules in the
          interim. Thus where the schematics and wiring diagrams match,
          we should feel confident in using the information we find in
          the wiring diagrams to supplement what we find in the
          schematics, but we need to be aware that they <i>may not</i>
          match, and that we must be prepared to work from whichever one
          of those two is "correct".<br>
          <br>
          All very well and good!&nbsp; But how do we know which, if
          either, <i>is</i> correct?&nbsp; I suppose I'd generally vote
          for the schematic, if only because the wiring diagram is a
          much less satisfactory way of visualizing how the circuit
          works.&nbsp; This is particular example of drawings 1006547
          and 1006127, though, there are lots of circumstantial factors
          that would make us choose the schematic over the wiring
          diagram:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The schematic was drawn 3 months later than the wiring
              diagram, and is therefore more current.</li>
            <li>We have 2 revisions of the wiring diagram vs 8 of the
              schematic, so gross errors seem less likely to have
              survived in the schematic than in the wiring diagram.</li>
            <li>The documentation in AC Electronics ND-1021041 matches
              the schematic rather than the wiring diagram.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
