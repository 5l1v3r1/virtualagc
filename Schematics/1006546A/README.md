This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006546A to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A32.  This revision ("A") is the only one presently available for this drawing.

Transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006126-), which is used to provide the reference designators and input-pin ordering for the NOR gates, since those are not explicitly shown on the schematic.  Since there is a revision mismatch between the schematic drawing and the wiring diagram, discrepancies between the two would not be unexpected, in which cases there have to be arbitrarily-chosen reference designators or input-pin assignments.
