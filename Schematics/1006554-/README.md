This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006554- to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A25.

Unfortunately, the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006134), which would normally have provided the reference designators and the ordering of the input pins for the NOR gates, was not available.  Therefore, the NOR gates' reference designators and input-pin ordering have been chosent arbitrarily in this transcription.  These choices affect only physical layout of the components and wires, and do not affect electrical behavior at all.
