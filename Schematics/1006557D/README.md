# Introduction

This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006557D to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A36.  We also have revisions 1006557- through 1006557C of the original drawing, though these have not been transcribed to CAD so far.  

At the same time, the schematic is supplemented by the original "signal wiring diagram", drawing 1006137-.  Signal wiring diagrams provide information lacking in the schematics, primarily reference designators and input-pin numbering for NOR gates.  The signal wiring diagrams also duplicate most of the NOR-gate and connector wiring, albeit with a certain degree of ambiguity, though this information is not needed by the transcription process.  

__Note:__ The schematic and wiring diagrams are at different revision levels, so mismatches between them are possible.  For such mismatched gates or wiring, it is necessary to arbitrarily assign reference designators and/or input-pin assignments.
