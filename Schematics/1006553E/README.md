# Introduction

This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006553E to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A22.  We also have revisions 1006553- through 1006553D of the original drawing, though they have not been transcribed to CAD.  

At the same time, the schematic is supplemented by the original "signal wiring diagram", of which we have drawing 1006133-.  Signal wiring diagrams provide information lacking in the schematics, primarily reference designators and input-pin numbering for NOR gates.  The signal wiring diagrams also duplicate most of the NOR-gate and connector wiring, albeit with a certain degree of ambiguity, though this information is not needed by the transcription process.  

__Note:__ It is likely that this revision ("-") of the signal-wiring diagram corresponds to an earlier revision of the schematic than revision E, and therefore it would not be unexpected for there to be discrepancies between the two.
