This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006541B to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A35.  The original of revision 1006541A is also available, but has not been transcribed to CAD as of this moment.

Transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006121-), which is used to provide the reference designators and input-pin ordering for the NOR gates, since those are not explicitly shown on the schematic.  Since there is a revision mismatch between the schematic drawing and the wiring diagram, discrepancies between the two would not be unexpected, in which cases there have to be arbitrarily-chosen reference designators or input-pin assignments.
