This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006550F to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A37.  We also have all earlier revisions (except "D") of the original drawing, though these have not been transcribed to CAD so far.  

At the same time, the schematic is supplemented by the original "signal wiring diagram", drawing 1006130-.  Signal wiring diagrams provide information lacking in the schematics, primarily reference designators and input-pin numbering for NOR gates.  The signal wiring diagrams also duplicate most of the NOR-gate and connector wiring, which turns out to be critical for a complete transcription of schematic 1006550F.

The original of wiring diagram 1006130- is of abyssmal quality [(check here if you don't believe me)](https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch2Images#page/n17/mode/1up) to the extent of being essentially unreadable if it were necessary to use it on a standalone basis. Remarkably, though, it turns out that _if_ you use the wiring diagram in conjunction with the schematic drawing and simply assume that the two will match, it is possible by the process of elimination to almost-uniquely determine the reference designators and input-pin assignments for all NOR gates, even though the wiring diagram is almost unreadable.  That is the procedure which has been followed for this transcription process.

Nevertheless, the determination of reference designators does not give _quite_ a unique result.  The one instance in which it does not relates to gates 37002 and 37003.  These two gates have identical inputs and outputs, and the notations for them on the wiring diagram are so light as to be invisible, hence, we cannot distinguish between them.  One of them is reference designator U1 and the other U9, but we cannot say which of them is which.

__Note:__ The schematic and wiring diagrams are at different revision levels, so mismatches between them are possible.  Fortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case here.
