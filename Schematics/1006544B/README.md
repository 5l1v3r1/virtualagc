This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006544B to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A27.  Revisions 1006544- and 1006544C are also available, although 1006544C is of such poor quality that I don't expect it to ever be usable for anything and should only be taken to demonstrate that 1006544B is in the final revision of the drawing.  1006544- has not been transcribed to CAD as now.

Transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006124-), which is used to provide the reference designators and input-pin ordering for the NOR gates, since those are not explicitly shown on the schematic.  Revision 1006124- of the wiring diagram is expected to correspond to schematic 1006544- rather than to 1006544B, so discrepancies between the two would not be unexpected.
