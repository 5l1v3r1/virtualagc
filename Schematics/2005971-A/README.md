This folder contains a KiCad transcription of drawing 2005971 (AGC power supply module A30-A31).  However, it does not correspond to any specific original revision of that drawing.  At this writing, the only available scans of the two sheets of 2005971 are:

* Sheet 1 of 2005971-
* Sheet 2 of 2005971-
* Sheet 1 of 2005971A

In lieu of simply transcribing 2005971- and discarding 2005971A, this transcription is a hybrid, in which sheet 1 (the circuit) is from 2005971A and sheet 2 (the bill of material) is from 2005971-.  It is consequently possible that there is an undetectable mismatch between these two, although cross-comparison of resistor, capacitor, and inductor values between the two sheets does not reveal any such mismatches.

That's why this folder has the weird designation "2005971-A" ... it's not quite "2005971-" and it's not quite "2005971-A".
