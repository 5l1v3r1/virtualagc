This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006551- to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A38.  It is the only presently-available revision of the drawing.  

At the same time, the schematic is supplemented by the original "signal wiring diagram", drawing 1006131A.  Signal wiring diagrams provide information lacking in the schematics, primarily reference designators and input-pin numbering for NOR gates.  The signal wiring diagrams also duplicate most of the NOR-gate and connector wiring, though most of this is not needed in a typical transcription process.

__Note:__ The schematic and wiring diagrams are at different revision levels, so mismatches between them are possible.  We do additionally have wiring diagram revision 1006131-, so mismatches can be cross-referenced with it as well.
