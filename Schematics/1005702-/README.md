This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1005702- to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC interface module A20/A40, for early Block AGC models.

The original drawing cover, comprising a single sheet, covers both the main circuit and the 4 types of reusable circuit blocks ("XT", "D", "P", "R") used by the main circuit.  Because of the way hierarchical circuit blocks are used in KiCad, the CAD transcription is instead made up of 5 sheets, one for the main circuit (module.sch), and one for each of the circuit-block types (XT.sch, D.sch, ....).  Each sheet is basicaly drawing 1005702- with the non-relevant circuitry removed.
