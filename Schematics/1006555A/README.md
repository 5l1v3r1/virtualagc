This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006555A to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A24.  Revision "-" of the drawing is also available, but has not (as of this writing) been transcribed to CAD.

The transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram, drawing 1006135-.  Signal wiring diagrams provide information lacking in the schematics, primarily reference designators and input-pin numbering for NOR gates.  The signal wiring diagrams also duplicate most of the NOR-gate and connector wiring, albeit with a certain degree of ambiguity, though this information is not needed by the transcription process.

__Note:__ The signal wiring diagram, at rev "-", likely corresponds to schematic 1006555- rather than to 1006555A, but is the best available source material.  Any discrepancies between the two will be noted in the CAD file.
