This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006559D to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A29.  The original drawings 1006559- through 1006559C are also available, though not presently in CAD form.

Transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006139A), which is used to provide the reference designators and input-pin ordering for the NOR gates, since those are not explicitly shown on the schematic.  Since there is a revision mismatch between the schematic drawing and the wiring diagram, discrepancies between the two would not be unexpected, in which cases there have to be arbitrarily-chosen reference designators or input-pin assignments. No such discrepanceis were recorded during the transcription process, though that is not a guarantee that none exist.
