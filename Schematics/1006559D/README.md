This folder contains the transcription of the original Apollo Program drawing 1006544B to KiCad.  This is the electrical schematic for Block I AGC module A27.  Revisions 1006544- and 1006544C are also available, although 1006544C is of such poor quality that I don't expect it to ever be usable for anything and should only be taken to demonstrate that 1006544B is in the final revision of the drawing.  1006544- has not been transcribed to CAD as now.

Transcription was aided by the signal wiring diagram (drawing 1006124-), which is used to provide the reference designators and input-pin ordering for the NOR gates, since those are not explicitly shown on the schematic.  Revision 1006124- of the wiring diagram is expected to correspond to schematic 1006544- rather than to 1006544B, so discrepancies between the two would not be unexpected, in which cases there have to be arbitrarily-chosen reference designators or input-pin assignments.  

And indeed, there _are_ electrical discrepancies between 1006544- and 1006544B that are reflected in discrepancies between 1006544B and 1006124-.  I've not attempted to exhaustively catalog these discrepancies, but one known case is that of NOR-gate 35139. In schematic revision 1006544-, gate 35139 accepts the same _inputs_ as gate 35140, and thus outputs a signal identical to that of gate 35140.  In schematic 1006544B, on the other hand, gate 35139 instead accepts the _output_ of gate 35140 as its input, and thus outputs the inverse of what 35140 outputs.  The net result is that connector pin 14 carries the signal MWXG/ in rev "-", but carries the signal MWXG in rev "B" (and in rev "C" as well; though too illegible to discern gate numbers or signal names, schematic rev "C" is legible enough to trace wiring from gate to gate).
