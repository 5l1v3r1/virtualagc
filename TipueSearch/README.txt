This folder contains downloads of the following software:

	Normalize.css 8.01
	jQuery 3.3.1
	TipqueSearch 7.1

All are available under the MIT License.  The file tipuesearch.js has 
been modified in several ways to format the search results in a more-
meaningful way.  These changes are useful only in the present context,
and would not be useful to send upstream.  But if updated from 
upstream sources, my mods will all be eliminated.  They can be found
easily, since they're all marked with the string "RSB".

The file tipuesearch_content.js is specific to this project.  Refer to
../TipueSearch.html in this "gh-pages" branch of this repository, and
in the "schematics" branch of this repository to the files
