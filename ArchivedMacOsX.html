Binaries</h2><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer:</span>&nbsp; I really
<span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> don't know how to
package programs for installation on Mac OS X.&nbsp; The binaries
may not work on your system.&nbsp; The installation procedures
may not work on your system, and are complex compared to what
you're used to (but easier than building from source).&nbsp; I
know that it worked on the 10.2 machine I used to build it, and I
have feedback (from Fabrizio Bernardini) that the binary package
works fine on 10.3.&nbsp; On the other hand, I personally tried
to install it on a friend's 10.3 machine, and the installation
failed at step #3, so I never got to find out if the Virtual AGC
program ran or not.&nbsp; Hopefully it'll work for you; if not,
you may still need to end up building Virtual AGC yourself, as
described <a href=
"#Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X">below</a>.&nbsp; If the
binary installation works for you, or if you understand how to
improve the process, let me know.&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; giving me a
link to a 10-page howto is <span style=
"font-style: italic;">not</span> the level of help I'm looking
for.)&nbsp; I apologize for the complexity relative to what
you're used to, but at my level of Mac OS (non-)skill you're
lucky to get anything at all.&nbsp; :-)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another disclaimer:</span>&nbsp;
I should warn you, I suppose, that it takes <span style=
"font-style: italic;">so long</span> to install the prerequisites
you need to run Virtual AGC, that you get very little advantage
from installing the Virtual AGC binary package rather than simply
building Virtual AGC from source.&nbsp; But enough
negativity!&nbsp; Let's get installing!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installation:</span><br><ol><li>Install the X-window system (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">XFree86</span>).&nbsp; For Panther, this
is apparently an optional install from your Apple-supplied Mac
OS X CDs.&nbsp; For Jaguar, you can download from the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX
project</a>.<br></li><li>Install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span></a>, which is a program that
is used to install other programs.&nbsp; Make sure that you
choose the version of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> that works with your version
of Mac OS X, and follow the instructions on the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> webpage.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
<span style="font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> version 2.&nbsp;
This is done from the command-line with "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install gtk+2</span>".</li><li>Now download the current Mac OS X binary package of Virtual
AGC (yaAGC-macosx-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2).&nbsp; On my
computer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">stuffit</span>
automatically unpacked this when I downloaded it.&nbsp; If not,
you'll have to manually unpack it from the command line, as
follows:</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop</span><br><span style="font-family: monospace;">bunzip2
yaAGC-macosx</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span></div><ol start=5><li>Install, with this command:</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo tar --directory=/
-xf yaAGC-macosx</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar</span></div><ol start=6><li>You'll probably still want the source-code tarball, since
it contains a lot of stuff (like source code for the Luminary
and Colossus programs) that aren't in the binary tarball.&nbsp;
So download yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span>.tar.bz2 and unpack
it, thus creating a directory called "yaAGC" containing the
stuff listed at the top of the page:</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">tar --bzip2 -xf
yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span></div><ol start=7><li>If you want to run Stephan Hotto's <a href=
"yaTelemetry.html"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a> program (and I bet
you do!), you'll need to install <a href=
"http://www.tcl.tk/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this
either by following the instructions at the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> website, or else use
"<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install
tcltk</span>".&nbsp; (I did the latter, myself, so I can't
really vouch for the former.)<br></li><li>Running the program is a little more complex than you're
used to:</li></ol><ul><ul><li>Run the X-window system.&nbsp; This will (as a side
effect) probably cause several command-line windows to open
up.</li><li>In one of the command-line windows that opened up, type
the following:</li></ul></ul><div style="margin-left: 120px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">set path = ($path
/usr/local/yaAGC/bin)</span><br style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">SimLuminary131<br></span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><ul><li>In some cases, the simulated DSKY won't immediately
display on the screen.&nbsp; Instead, the cursor will simply
change shape, indicating that it wants you to position the
DSKY on the screen.&nbsp; Click on the screen, and the
simulated DSKY will appear where you click.<br></li></ul></div><ol start=9><li>You can stop the program simply by stopping the X-window
system.&nbsp; If you don't want to do that (say, because you
have other X programs running also), then stopping the program
is also a little complex:</li></ol><ul><ul><li>Use the mouse to focus the command-line window you used
to start the program.</li><li>Hit ctrl-C on the keyboard to stop the CPU
emulation.</li><li>Type the command "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">killall yaDSKY</span>" to stop the
DSKY emulation.<br></li></ul></ul><ol 0><li>Enjoy, if you're still capable of it after all
that!<br></li></ol><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Uninstallation:</span>&nbsp; Just remove the
/usr/local/yaAGC directory containing the binaries, and the
Desktop/yaAGC directory containing the sources.<br><h2><a name=Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X id=
"Building_Virtual_AGC_in_Mac_OS_X"></a>Building Virtual AGC in
Mac OS X</h2>I had significant help in getting Virtual AGC
working on Mac OS X.&nbsp; Matteo Giani was the first to get
Virtual AGC working, on Mac OS X Panther (10.3); in Virtual AGC
version 20040828 and later I've incorporated the changes he
needed to make to get it to work.&nbsp; <a href=
"MacOSscreenshot.pdf">Here's a screenshot</a> Matteo has given
me.&nbsp; After some additional advice from <a href=
"GregDunnPanther.txt">Greg Dunn</a>, and the appearance of a
document from Apple called "<a href=
"http://developer.apple.com/darwin/runningx11.html">Configuring
and Running X11 Applications on Mac OS X</a>", I've managed to
get Virtual AGC working in Mac OS X Jaguar (10.2) as well.&nbsp;
Presumably it will work in all other versions of Mac OS X, but I
can hardly guarantee it.&nbsp; In fact, I have had reports that
it failed to build even on some 10.3 machines, so apparently it's
not entirely consistent.<br><br>
While none of the steps below is difficult, building the software
nevertheless requires a lot more command-line work than the
typical Mac OS X user finds congenial.&nbsp; A binary installer
would be <span style="font-style: italic;">much</span> better for
the typical user.&nbsp; Sadly, I don't know how to package the
executables to allow them to be installed directly on a Mac
without all of this nonsense, because I'm not a Mac software
developer at heart and haven't the energy to learn.&nbsp;
Step-by-step instructions for creating an installer (perhaps in
the form of mods to the makefiles) from anybody who <span style=
"font-style: italic;">does</span> know would be very welcome.<br><br>
The following instructions have been tested on a pristine
installation of Jaguar (10.2.8).&nbsp; (In other words, I
completely wiped my Mac and reinstalled Mac OS X, just to make
sure these instructions would work.)&nbsp; To begin with, you'll
need to install a substantial amount of stuff on your Mac.&nbsp;
It will use up a lot of disk space and take a long time to do
so.<br><ol><li>Install Apple's "developer tools", either from the CD that
Apple supplies with the Mac OS X installation CDs, or as a
download from Apple.</li><li>Install the X-window system (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">XFree86</span>).&nbsp; For Panther, this
is apparently an optional install from your Apple-supplied Mac
OS X CDs.&nbsp; For Jaguar, you can download from the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX
project</a>.<br></li><li>(Optional.)&nbsp; Install the <a href=
"http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a> cross-platform GUI
kit.&nbsp; This is only needed to build <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, which is presently only in
the early development stage.&nbsp; If you skip this step, the
build-process (below) will display warnings and fail to build
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>, but will work
normally otherwise.&nbsp; However, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> gives you the ability to use
the rotational hand controller (RHC) in the LM, and that
substantially adds to the fun-factor of using the
simulation.&nbsp; (Sadly, when <span style=
"font-style: italic;">I</span> try installing <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span> on my iMac, it fails to do
so, so I really don't have the option.)<br></li><li>Install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span></a>, which is a program that
is used to install other programs.&nbsp; Make sure that you
choose the version of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> that works with your version
of Mac OS X, and follow the instructions on the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">fink</span> webpage.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
<span style="font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> version 2.&nbsp;
This is done from the command-line with "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install gtk+2</span>".</li><li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">fink</span> to install
<span style="font-weight: bold;">automake</span> ("sudo fink
install automake").&nbsp; These are already present on your
computer, but the Apple-supplied version didn't work for
me.&nbsp; Fortunately, this new version won't conflict with
your Apple-supplied ones, which will remain on your
computer.</li><li>If you want to run Stephan Hotto's <a href=
"yaTelemetry.html"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span></a> program (and I bet
you do!), you'll need to install <a href=
"http://www.tcl.tk/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this
either by following the instructions at the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> website, or else use
"<span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo fink install
tcltk</span>".&nbsp; (I've done only the latter, so I don't
know how well the former works.)</li><li>Now download the current development snapshot of Virtual
AGC (yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">XXXXXXXX</span>.tar.bz2).&nbsp; On my
computer, <span style="font-weight: bold;">stuffit</span>
automatically unpacked this when I downloaded it.&nbsp; If not,
you'll have to manually unpack it from the command line, as
follows:</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop<br>
bunzip2 yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar.bz2</span><span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
tar -xf yaAGC-dev</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: monospace;">-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">RevisionCode</span></span></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">.tar<br><br></span></div>Now that all of the tools you need are installed, you build
Virtual AGC basically by just following the same (command-line)
instructions as do the Linux folk:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">cd Desktop<br>
cd yaAGC</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">./configure
--prefix=/sw</span><br style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">make<br>
sudo make install<br></span></div><br>
Having built and installed Virtual AGC, you run it like this:<br><ul><li>The installation of the X-window system will have provided
some way to start the X-window system.&nbsp; (On Jaguar, there
is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">XDarwin</span> icon on
the desktop.)&nbsp; Go ahead and start X-windows.</li><li>Starting X-windows will (hopefully) will call up one or
more 'xterm' command-line windows.&nbsp; Within one of these
windows, simply use the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span> or <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span> command,
<span style="font-style: italic;">et voila</span>!</li><li>Proceed over to <a href="index.html#Quick_Start">quick
start</a> on the home page to see some things you can do with
it.</li></ul>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; The
following advice presently doesn't work very well, and is present
for future purposes.)&nbsp; <span style=
"color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">It may be that you just can't build
the software, no matter how hard you try.&nbsp; In almost all
cases, the reason for this will be a problem in installation or
configuration of</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">gtk+</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(with which I'll
probably be unable to help), and that all of the programs will
build fine except for</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">yaDSKY</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">and</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">yaDEDA</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">.&nbsp;
In this case, as a last resort, you can do the
following:</span><br style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><ol style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><li>Instead of "./configure --prefix=/sw", do "make NOGUI=yes
PREFIX=/sw autogen".</li><li>Instead of "make", do "make NOGUI=yes".<br></li><li>Instead of "sudo make install", do "sudo make NOGUI=yes
install".</li><li>Instead of running "SimLuminary131" or "SimColossus249",
run "SimLuminary131_lite" or "SimColossus249_lite".</li></ol><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">What these steps
will do for you is to bypass the problematic steps such as
building</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">yaDSKY</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">and</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">yaDEDA</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">,
