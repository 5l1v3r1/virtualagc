    <p>This page provides Grumman Apollo Lunar Module electrical and
      mechanical drawings from a aperture-card box @BOX_TBD@ stored at the
      U.S. National Archives Southwest branch in Fort Worth,
      Texas.&nbsp; Any given box is mostly devoted to a specific
      numerical drawing-number range, except for filing errors.&nbsp;
      Besides the drawing-index on this web-page, the following related
      resources are available:<br>

    In the following table, <b>Type</b>=DW is a "drawing", while <b>Type</b>=EO
    is an "engineering order".<br>
    <br>
    Scans whose drawing
    numbers are shown in </font>red</font> (<font color="#ff0000">LDW280-12345</font>),
    have been identified as having legibility problems serious enough to
    jeopardize recovery of information from those particular scans of
    the drawings.&nbsp; In most cases the illegibility is due to the
    scanner settings used, thus rescanning with different settings may
    produce a more-legible result.&nbsp; Any rescans which have been
    attempted subsequently will be found <a href="#RESCANS">below the
    main table</a>.<br>
