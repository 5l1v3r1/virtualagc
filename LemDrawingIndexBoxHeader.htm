    <p>This page provides Grumman Apollo Lunar Module electrical and
      mechanical drawings from a aperture-card box @BOX_TBD@ stored at the
      U.S. National Archives Southwest branch in Fort Worth,
      Texas.&nbsp; Any given box is mostly devoted to a specific
      numerical drawing-number range, except for filing errors.&nbsp;
      Besides the drawing-index on this web-page, the following related
      resources are available:<br>

    In the following table, <b>Type</b>=DW is a "drawing", while <b>Type</b>=EO
    is an "engineering order".<br>
    <br>
    <b>Warning:</b>&nbsp; This index table is based on metadata
    originally punched into the aperture cards holding the microfilmed
    slides of the drawings.&nbsp; <i>That original punched metadata was
      often incorrect, as well as lacking drawing-title information!</i>&nbsp;

    The drawing numbers or other data listed below may therefore be
    inaccurate; however, wherever drawing titles are shown, then a
    manual correction to the metadata has subsequently taken place and
    the data is much more likely to be accurate.<br>
