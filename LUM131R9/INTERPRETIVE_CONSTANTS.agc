## Filename:    INTERPRETIVE_CONSTANTS.agc
## Purpose:     A section of LUM131 revision 9.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              third release of the flight software for the Lunar 
##              Module's (LM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 13.
##              The code has been recreated from a copy of Luminary 131.
##              It has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for LUM131 revision 9 in NASA
##              drawing 2021152L, which gives relatively high confidence that
##              the reconstruction is correct.
