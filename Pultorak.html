height="144" border="0" align="right"></a>John Pultorak has
constructed a physical (not virtual), working model of a Block I AGC
out of 74LS-series low-power Schottky TTL devices.&nbsp; The model
works, and runs software which John has adapted from Colossus 249
software.&nbsp; John's unit even has the same general appearance as
the original Block I AGC prototype!&nbsp; Of course, Colossus 249
software is targeted for the Block II AGC rather than the Block I
AGC, but John did not then know of any existing Block I source code,
and indeed, even the Colossus 249 software listing he had at the
time was only a partial one rather than a complete program.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I think I've harped on this point endlessly in the past, but at the
risk of beating a dead horse, please don't expect John's schematics
to be the <i>actual</i> Block I AGC schematics.&nbsp; Those simply
weren't publicly available when John did his work.&nbsp; John's
work, rather, is a fantastic creation of a workalike, based on his
reading of available documentation.&nbsp; The Block I AGC and DSKY
schematics have since become available, though, and if you want
those the place to look is on <a href="ElectroMechanical.html">our
electro-mechanical page</a> rather than here.&nbsp; Okay, you've
been warned now, whether you wanted a warning about it or not, so
feel free to continue reading about John's accomplishment!<br><br>
No manned mission ever flew with a Block I AGC.&nbsp; It was
originally intended that Apollo 1 and Apollo 2 would be Block I
missions; but I'm sure you know what happened to Apollo 1, and
Apollo 2 never took place.&nbsp; The unmanned missions AS-202
(sometimes referred to as Apollo 3, though it took place before
Apollo 1 would have), Apollo 4, and Apollo 6 did use Block I AGCs.<br><br>
John has thoughtfully provided us at Virtual AGC with his schematic
diagrams, with adapted Block II software, and with his
cross-assembler, all of which are a bit tricky otherwise to get in
machine-readable form.&nbsp; He has also documented his project in
what I'll refer to as the <span style="font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;">Pultorak PDFs</span>, which you may find a lot
of other places on the web, but which I provide here as well, since
why not?&nbsp; The following block quote is simply a duplicate of

It's not.&nbsp; John's project is not an offshoot of the Virtual AGC
project, or vice-versa, and neither project uses materials created
by the other.&nbsp; But John's project is at an end, and he doesn't
want the hassle of maintaining a web presence for it, whereas
Virtual AGC is an ongoing project.&nbsp; (But <a
href="../../../../media/STORAGE/home/rburkey/Desktop/sandroid.org/public_html/apollo/Block1.html">
see our Block 1 page</a>.)&nbsp; So as a courtesy, the Virtual AGC
website is going to host supplemental materials for the Pultorak
project that haven't worked their way into the other websites
mentioned above.<br><br>
I should mention, though, that it was John who acquired for us all
of the documentation and source code that we presently have for <a
href="yaAGS.html">the LM's abort computer</a>.&nbsp; (Of course, I
had to write the assembler and simulator myself, so he didn't do <i>everything</i>
for us!)&nbsp; And, the existence of his <i>software</i> Block I
simulation (see below), which he wrote in preparation for his
hardware simulation, has been extremely helpful in the creation of
our own Block I simulator.&nbsp; So it would be hard to overestimate
the value John has had for us a Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Thanks, John!<br><h2>The Supplemental Materials</h2><h3>Copyright and Licensing</h3>
The Pultorak PDFs do not address the question of copyright for the
software or schematics, nor the conditions under which they may be
used by others, though the webpages themselves are copyrighted by
John.&nbsp; Obviously, the quote from klabs.or earlier claims that
John has put them into the public domain. John has told me that he
wants everyone to be able to use the software and hardware
freely.&nbsp; <a href="Pultorak_files/PdReply.html">Click here to
see an email in which he explains this</a>.&nbsp; (And just in
case you wonder about the context, <a
href="Pultorak_files/PdQuestion.html">click here to see email
containing my copyright/licensing questions</a> to which he is
replying.)<br><h3>AGC Source Code</h3>
AGC source code (flight software adapted for Block I and for John's
cross-assembler, test &amp; checkout software, and so forth) is
provided in the Pultorak PDFs, but you have to have some means of
extracting them to use them for anything.&nbsp; Moreover, the PDFs
often provide assembly listings—i.e., reports generated by the
assembler—rather than pure source code.&nbsp; An assembly listing
isn't a legal assembly-language source-code file, so you can't
conveniently change and reassemble it.&nbsp; You can get a zipfile
containing the source code and some supplemental files (such as hex
files) by <a href="Pultorak_files/PultorakAgcSoftware.zip">
clicking here</a> (1 MB).&nbsp;<br><br>
Unfortunately, the format accepted by John's cross-assembler isn't
compatible with <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> (or
vice-versa), so these source files cannot be assembled by <span
style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp; They must be
assembled using John's cross-assembler.<br><h3><a name=AssemblerSimulatorSourceCode></a>Assembler and
Simulator Source Code</h3>
The Visual C++ source code for John's PC-based cross-assembler and
simulator do appear in the Pultorak PDFs, but rather than
cutting-and-pasting you may find it more convenient to download a
zipfile by <a
href="Pultorak_files/PultorakAssemblerAndSimulator.zip"> clicking
here</a> (3.7 MB).&nbsp; In addition to John's original code,
there is work in progress on <a
href="Block1.html#John_Pultoraks_Assembler_and_Simulator">a
corrected, cross-platform version of that code for gcc</a>, and on
<a href="Block1.html#Virtual_AGCs_CPU_Simulator_yaAGCb1">an
alternative cross-platform simulator with an unrelated source-code
base</a>.<br><h3>Circuit Design<br></h3>
The Pultorak PDFs do provide schematic diagrams, but some readers
have commented that it is difficult to make out some of the details
in them.&nbsp; You can download a zipfile containing the complete
CAD files for the design by <a
href="Pultorak_files/PultorakFinalLogicDesign.zip"> clicking here</a>
(1.7 MB).&nbsp; The CAD files are in <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Circuitmaker</span> format (*.ckt), but even if you don't
have a copy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker,</span>
the zipfile may be worth downloading because it also contains:<br><ul><li>WMF (Windows Metafile) versions of the schematics that are
more legible than those in the Pultorak PDFs; and</li><li>An Excel spreadsheet with a partlist for the design.</li></ul>
At the time John created these materials and first sent them to me,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span> was available
commercially, and if you couldn't afford the full version of the
program you could either have downloaded the free but limited
"student" version of the software, or else you could download a full
but time-limited demo version of the program.&nbsp; Since that time,
however, the company which was selling <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Circuitmaker</span> has apparently been acquired by Altium,
and <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">the</span> <span
style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Circuitmaker</span><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">program has been</span> <span
style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">discontinued</span>.&nbsp;</span>
According to <a href="http://www.circuitmaker.com">Altium's website</a>,
the substantially more expensive <span style="font-weight: bold;">Altium
Designer</span> product is supposed to be able to import existing
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
schematics.&nbsp; I have no idea whether this is true or not, though
my past experiences in such situations leads me to be suspicious
about it.&nbsp; If anybody else has tried it (and cares to convert
John's schematics for me), please let me know.<br><br>
In order to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>,
you have to use Options/LibraryLocation (full or demo version) or
File/Preferences/DirectoriesAndFiles (student version) on the menu
to set the location of the "user library" (USER.LIB) that comes in
our zipfile.&nbsp; (After doing so, you will probably also have to
exit from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span> and
then re-run it, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
will already have loaded the default USER.LIB into its internal
cache, and it won't reload it until being restarted.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Otherwise, when you load the schematics they will have wires but no
electrical components on them.&nbsp; Incidentally, although <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker2000</span> is a Windows
program, both the student and demo versions run just fine under
Linux with <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/">CrossOver Office</a>.&nbsp;
They may run fine too under normal <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine</a>,
but I haven't tried it.<br><br>
One thing you will likely want to do with <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Circuitmaker</span> is to create a netlist.&nbsp; Neither
the student nor demo versions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
seem to want to admit the notion that a single IC can contain
multiple gates, and will therefore likely display an error prompt
asking if you want to "correct" this condition.&nbsp; If you say
"yes", <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span> will
arbitrarily relabel the components within the schematic, so that
only one gate appears in each package.&nbsp; My advice would be to
say "no" (not to correct), as the only negative side-effect of doing
so appears to be that the netlist file will have duplicate entries
for the packages with multiple gates, but the wire-list will be
correct.<br><h3><a name=Polehn></a>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3><div> Donna Polehn has created an GUI IDE (I think, Windows only)
based on the Pultorak Simulator and assembler, which you can find
at <a title="https://github.com/donnaware/AGC"
href="https://github.com/donnaware/AGC">https://github.com/donnaware/AGC</a>.&nbsp;
In order to build it, you need C++Builder 6.&nbsp; I've not tried
it, since I don't personally have C++Builder 6 and don't normally
run Windows, but I expect it's interesting.<br><br>
Donna tells us also that she has made a functional Block I using
the Terasic DE0 FPGA development board, as well as a custom FPGA
board.&nbsp; Those are available at the link listed above.<br><br><hr  size="2"><h1><a name=Mike_Stewarts_Block_II_AGC_Project></a>Mike
Stewart's Block II AGC Project<br></h1>
You can find all the data on Mike's project at these two GitHub
sites:<br><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware">https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_simulation">https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_simulation</a><br></li></ul>
You have to take what I say about Mike's project with a bit of a
grain of salt, because Mike has used his Block II simulator as a
weapon for justice, rather than treating it as a work of art, and
so I have to give him very high marks just on that basis
alone.&nbsp;<br><br>
No, wait, is that what I wanted to say?<br><br>
I jest, of course, but it may not be so far off.&nbsp; What Mike
has done, in his quest to perfect his simulation, has been
unique.&nbsp; He has used his hardware simulator to do detailed
comparisons against our own software AGC simulator, <b>yaAGC</b>,
and to <i>repair</i> yaAGC when he has found it to be broken in
some way, along the way becoming a top contributor to the Virtual
AGC project.&nbsp; The problems he has found have certainly been
subtle, but real.&nbsp; One benefit to Virtual AGC is that bugs
preventing yaAGC's use for landing the NASSP/Orbiter LM on the
Moon have been fixed, and I got a nice note a few weeks ago (say,
in late August of 2016) saying that they had finally landed on the
Moon with any program alarms or other problems!&nbsp; But there
has apparently been some help flowing in the opposite direction as
well, since Mike tells me that Jim Lawton's AGC wire-lister from <a
href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/tree/master/Contributed/WireLister">
our own GitHub repository</a> was essential to his work.&nbsp;
Go figure!&nbsp; I didn't even know it was there.&nbsp; Good job,
Jim!<br><br>
As part of this, Mike has also been instrumental in acquiring
AURORA, a very early AGC LM program, because it was the <i>last</i>
AGC program to contain a full suite of test-suite software, which
should help him (and us!) to locate yet other subtle bugs in the
simulations, if bugs there be.<br><br>
Mike's project also stands out because he has used open-source
tools, so if you have the time, the expertise, and the will, you
can reuse the material from his project without having to acquire
proprietary tools to do so.<br><br>
So while I haven't any fancy exclusive-to-VirtualAGC graphics of
Mike's work to present to you here, I can't help but recommend it
highly to you!<br><br><hr  size="2"><h1><a name=Steven_Hauers_Implementation></a>Steven Hauer's
Implementation</h1>
Although (see preceding section) I don't have fancy graphics from
Mike Stewart's project to show you, Steven Hauer has been busy
working on implementing Mike's work, and has sent graphics
galore.&nbsp; Because I am lazy, I'll let Steven describe it for
you himself without any of my normal, pesky reinterpretations or
editing.<br><blockquote><h3><font size="-1">OVERVIEW</font></h3><font size="-1">Here is a physical implementation currently in
progress of Mike Stewart's Block II AGC design.&nbsp; I
started the process of creating this AGC about 20 months ago
by researching available AGC design information and
implementation examples.&nbsp; I wanted to create a Block II
version of the AGC capable of running the full software.&nbsp;
The idea of creating an AGC that mimics the original Block II
circuits also appealed to me greatly, so Mike's design based
exclusively on NOR gates, inverters, and open collector
drivers was exactly what I was looking for.<br><br>
I have implemented Mike's design of A01 - A24 plus his version
of the fixed/erasable memory board B01 exactly as defined in
his KiCad schematics available online.&nbsp; The only
exception is a change in memory devices used on B01 to options
available for 5V logic and through-hole design.&nbsp; <br><br>
I intend this AGC to demonstrate full functionality so I have
brought out the full set of I/O signals and the monitor
connector signals.&nbsp; I use the monitor connector signals
for basic integration testing via a monitor breakout board of
my own design that also provides interfaces to a logic
analyzer.<br><br>
Instead of the transformer coupled I/O of the original AGC, I
applied open collector digital drivers for all outputs added
directly to the I/O boards.&nbsp; For the inputs I used a
simple emitter follower for the high speed inputs and the
original 'D' circuits for handling the switch inputs.&nbsp;
The simplification of the signal conditioning allowed me to
use only 2 interface circuit boards.<br><br>
My intention is to eventually create a full complement of
hardware based simulations of all peripheral devices,
uplink/downlink, and a working hardware implementation of the
monitor console (also called the core rope simulator) to
demonstrate historically accurate monitor functionality.<br></font><h3><font size="-1">DSKY</font></h3><font size="-1">The DSKY design is my own.&nbsp; Instead of
multiplexing the display drivers like in John Pultorak's DSKY,
I have decided to drive the led segments primarily from open
collector driver ICs and each 7-segment display will have its
own latching BCD decoder/driver instead of latching
relays.&nbsp; The translation of the AGC digit values to BCD
will be accomplished with some old 32x8 bit fused link bipolar
PROMS.&nbsp; Decoding of the AGC OUT1 channel (channel 10 oct)
will use a combination of a 4 to 16 decoder and a series of
nor-gate based flip flops and gating logic similar to the AGC
implementation.<br><br>
The DSKY push buttons are as close to the orginals as I could
find comercially available.&nbsp; They will be wired identical
to the original DSKY and make use of the same diode array for
encoding.<br><br>
There will be 4 PCBs in the DSKY:<br>
- Display board<br>
- Display driver board<br>
- Decode and latch board<br>
- I/O board with signal conditioning and the push button diode
array<br><br>
I currently have the first two boards completed.<br></font><h3><font size="-1">AGC CONSTRUCTION</font></h3><font size="-1">Each AGC module is fabricated on a 4 layer PCB
using 14-pin DIP packages.&nbsp; I initially thought I would
wire-wrap each module but after completing A01 and A02 I
quickly determined that wire-wrapping the modules was not a
viable option so I went with PCBs.&nbsp; I used KiCad for all
PCB layout to ensure they matched Mike's schematics.<br><br>
The chassis is made of aluminum plate and angle stock.&nbsp;
The plates for the module connectors and the card guides were
ordered online and laser cut.<br><br>
The backplane is wire-wrapped by hand.&nbsp; I generated a
backplane netlist within KiCad and printed out a hard
copy.&nbsp; Careful use of highlighter markers and triple
counting each pin has so far yielded an error free
backplane.&nbsp; The backplane took about 10 months of part
time effort (several hundred hours) to complete and I ended up
using about 2200 feet of wire.<br></font><h3><font size="-1">CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY</font></h3><font size="-1">Pictures show completed AGC with modules A01 -
A24 plus two input conditioning boards.&nbsp; I've included
some logic analyzer screen shots showing the first time I got
GOJAM working and also a couple screen shots showing the 4
instructions of the startup entry vector executing from the
validate code.&nbsp; The screen shots showing instruction
names are driven from signals via the monitor connector
breakout board.<br><br>
Current computer runs validation program successfully through
to completion.&nbsp; I don't have a DSKY yet so I confirmed
successful completion by watching '77' be written to CH10
(oct) for the DSKY signaling the sucessful completion of the
program.<br><br>
I have also loaded Luminary 210 and the program runs without
any alarms other than 'NO ATT' which makes sense since there
is no IMU (yet).&nbsp; I can watch PINBALL (the DSKY control
routine) clear the DSKY via my logic analyzer and observe some
of the interrupt driven idle behavior of Luminary at this
point.<br></font><h3><font size="-1">FUTURE PLANS</font></h3><font size="-1">After the DSKY is complete, I plan on creating
an interface to allow my physical AGC / DSKY to connect to the
Orbiter spaceflight simulator, with the NASSP 8.0
Apollo-mission add-on.&nbsp; Instead of interfacing this
package to yaAGC, I will instead connect it to an adaptor that
will take the data stream created for the 'ya' packages and
translate the packet data to/from the correct hardware signals
to interface with my AGC.<br><br></font><div align=right>— Steven Hauer, 11/2018<br></div></blockquote>

mockup of the Apollo 16 Command Module ("Casper") for 2012
exhibition called Esplorando, in Varese, Italy, near Milan.&nbsp;
Dario's part of the task was to create a working DSKY, which would
be interfaced via bluetooth to a PC running the Artemis AGC
program in our yaAGC AGC simulator software.&nbsp; Of course,
yaAGC has no direct bluetooth support, but Dario wrote a C++
program that interfaced between yaAGC and bluetooth.&nbsp; <br><br>
Apparently, the exhibition went very well.&nbsp; Charlie Duke, the
LMP for Apollo 16, was one of the visitors.&nbsp; I'm told that he
entered the capsule, played with the AGC/DSKY combo, said that it
was very realistic, and passed his compliments to us.&nbsp; So ...
thanks, Dario! <br><br>
Actually, there's a YouTube video, with Charlie Duke, of the
Casper mockup's unveiling ceremony: <br><br><div align=center><iframe

After Esplorando, the capsule was moved to the flight museum
located in the Malpensa International Airport, in Milan.<br><br>
Here's a YouTube link to a short video of Dario's AGC/DSKY combo
in operation:<br><br><div align=center><iframe

Since then, Dario has managed to port yaAGC into an embedded
system, based on the PIC32-MZ (a 32-bit MIPS-based MCU), with 2MB
of flash memory and 512KB of RAM, using the XC32 gcc-based
compiler.&nbsp; Dario himself works at Microchip (the
manufacturer) himself, so that seems like a natural progression.<br><br><div align=center><a href="PIC32MZ.jpg"><img alt=""

Vitoris's Block I and Block II AGC Project<br></h1>
The project of Dimitris ("Jim") Vitoris takes over where John
Pultorak's project stops.&nbsp; The project is still in its very
first stages, so please don't take any statements made here as
commitments!&nbsp; But the basic idea of the project is to be able
to create a physical implementation of a Block II AGC and DSKY,
which (unlike John Pultorak's Block I AGC above) can be constructed
by hobbyists, without requiring the immense skill needed to
construct a Pultorak AGC.<br><br>
Here is a <span style="font-style: italic;">very uncertain</span>
roadmap of the project.&nbsp; It may be that all of these phases
will be completed, or it may be that the project will stop where it
is now.&nbsp; Or perhaps some phases might be skipped.&nbsp; There
is no timetable.&nbsp; But however it goes, thanks Dimitris!<br><br><table summary="" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;"

Dimitris uses <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span> CAD for
this project (<a href="http://www.cadsoft.de">www.cadsoft.de</a>).&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span> is a cross-platform
program that is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.&nbsp;
While <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span> is a
proprietary program that costs money to purchase, there is a free
version that can be used with small designs.&nbsp; I have verified
that the free version does allow viewing of the phase A0 schematics
on Linux.<br><br>
Once phase B0 and beyond are reached, it would be valuable to have
mechanical design and drawings of things such as DSKYs, enclosures,
front panels, and so forth, so that complete physical units can be
constructed.&nbsp; Any mechanical engineers who are interested
should contact me at the email address at the bottom of this
page.&nbsp; Mechanical design of a Block II DSKY in particular would
be useful, regardless of the how far Dimitris cares to advance his
project.<br><br>
Dimitris has also sent some photos of the physical device he is
constructing:<br><br><table summary="" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;"

Dave Roberts made a physical simulation of a Block II AGC, written
in VHDL for a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA.&nbsp; <a
href="http://opencores.org/websvn,listing,agcnorm">His code can be
found here</a>.&nbsp; It was apparently, at least partially,
intended to work with <a
href="http://www.therpf.com/f11/apollo-lem-5-dsky-agc-188757/">Tony
David's physical DSKY</a>, about which I know nothing.<br><br>
Unfortunately, Dave was having some problems with his hardware Block
II simulator at the time of the last commit (in 2012) of his source
code as listed above, particularly in regard to the DV instruction.
He apparently later fixed this DV problem, but the fix never
migrated online.&nbsp; In point of fact, at that time yaAGC (which
of course, Dave does not use) also had a number of problems with the
implementation of the DV instruction, later fixed by Mike Stewart,
and some of Dave's problem may have related to the Validation Suite
of AGC code we provide having been in error due to this.<br><ul></ul><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><h1><a name=Whos_Building_Them></a>Who's Building Them?<br></h1><h2><a name=Alessandro_Cinquemani></a>Alessandro Cinquemani<br></h2>

done so, feel free to send me some photos and/or descriptions of
what you've built.&nbsp; Where is <a

which Alessandro built by following through on John Pultorak's
documentation.&nbsp; Alessandro is still working on the MEM and
PROC modules, but when the AGC is fully operational is
considering making actual circuit boards.&nbsp; Great job,

My personal bias is that I'd prefer it if these materials were
available for use with a free and open-source CAD system rather than
proprietary systems such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span>. &nbsp; The
subsequent discontinuation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
program (mentioned above) puts the problem in stark relief:&nbsp;
John Pultorak spent a lot of time creating these materials, and yet
within just a few years nobody will be able even to open the CAD
files he created.&nbsp; This website deals with things that happened
(as of this writing) 40 years ago, and I'd like the&nbsp;
information presented here to still be useful 40 years from now ...
or 400.&nbsp; But the CAD files have proven to have a shelf-life of
less than 5!<br><br>
Such absurd situations should come as no surprise to anybody with
substantial experience in using electrical CAD systems.&nbsp;
Speaking from experience, <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span>
proprietary electrical CAD program is eventually discontinued either
by virtue of acquisition of the manufacturer or else a strategic
decision by the manufacturer, and the schematic format is then
orphaned, usually even without any documentation.&nbsp; Yet I've
never encountered an electrical designer who had noticed this fact
or believed it was a problem; instead, CAD software is invariably
chosen on the basis of whatever features are most convenient to the
designer at that moment in time. &nbsp; Indeed, I've made such
selections myself, based on whatever software has the fastest or
best autorouter.&nbsp; But the autorouter relates only to PCB
layout, and has essentially no relation to schematic capture, which
could be done by a separate program from the PCB layout program
entirely. Schematic capture and PCB layout are interrelated only by
exchange of netlists and back-annotation info, and the notion that
the two must be integrated into one program is a fantasy promoted by
CAD manufacturers and swallowed <span style="font-style: italic;">en
masse</span> by circuit designers.&nbsp; I'd venture the advice
that if you're going to use a proprietary CAD program, it's best to
use one that supports the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orcad</span>
file format, and to archive your work in that format, since it's the
closest thing to a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>
standard that exists at the present time.<br><br>
It would be nice if an open-source CAD tools were used instead, so
that the schematics, PCB layouts, etc., would be freely editable by
everybody without purchasing a proprietary tool.&nbsp; If anybody
wants to convert the CAD files into a more open format, your help
would be welcomed.&nbsp; Among those who think the way I do, the <a
href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">open-source KiCad tool</a> seems to
have currently captured the most mind-share, and if all the cool
kids are using it, you may as well too!&nbsp; Of course, if you
absolutely insisted, we'd be happy to have <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Orcad</span>, or any other format as
well!&nbsp; I've so far not found an automated tool to perform the
conversion of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span> to any other
format.&nbsp; (If you wanted to write a program that converted <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Circuitmaker</span> or <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Eagle</span> files to&nbsp; some open
format, I'm sure that would be even more valuable than the
conversion itself.)<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><center> <br><span style="color: rgb(84, 89, 93); font-family: sans-serif;
