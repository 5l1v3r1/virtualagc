    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our
      core developers did participate, and there is a certain synergy
      between the restoration effort and the Virtual AGC Project, so I
      think it is reasonable to give some information about the
      restoration effort here.&nbsp; If you see something bogus here,
      blame me and not the restorers!<br>
    </p>
    <p>As for this specific webpage, it is UNDER CONSTRUCTION and
      largely INCOMPLETE at the moment.&nbsp; My intention is not to
      provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the
      restoration, which I'm not capable of doing anyway, and so it will
      stay largely incomplete until the restoration has been completed
      ... which hasn't happened yet. <br>

    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img alt="" src="restorationAGC.jpg" height="331"
        width="497"> &nbsp;<a href="restorationAGC2.jpg"><img
          title="Click to enlarge" alt=""

        height="331" width="504"></p>
    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I have not been in contact with Jimmie (I think), but according
      to online information, he worked in Project Apollo as a thermal
      vacuum test technician, and was thus in a good position years
      later to recognize the AGC when he saw it in a warehouse of junk
      that was intended to be scrapped for recycling purposes.&nbsp;
      After rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was eventually
      conceived of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8 (Lunar Test
      Article), which seems like a reasonable hypothesis since G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system 602 did indeed use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071, and we have no record of that AGC model having been
      used for any other purpose.&nbsp; On the other hand, one of the
      circuit modules in the AGC is dated 1970, so if this AGC had been
      used in LTA-8, some of its modules were swapped out much
      later.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602, of which we have <a
        href="6014999-021.html">the engineering drawings</a><a
        href="6014999-021.html"></a>, including the drawings for AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; By "engineering drawings", of course, I mean
      the mechanical drawings and the electrical schematics.&nbsp; Other
      pertinent facts about G&amp;N system #602 are that it would have
      used DSKY model 2003985-081 (whose drawings are also at the link
      just given) and that the AGC would have been loaded with the
      AURORA software.&nbsp; We have a copy of AURORA 12, and you can
      view it in a variety of forms, including <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a pretty-printed
        transcription to source code</a>.&nbsp; Whether this is the <i>exact</i>
      version of the software is unclear, but it is a version that would
      undoubedly have functioned adequately in LTA-8.&nbsp; A
      significant fact about AURORA is it includes a full suite of
      self-test software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software version to do
      so, since in later versions the self-test was greatly curtailed in
      order to save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus AURORA was typically the
      software used during Project Apollo itself to check out the AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of youtube videos
      about their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both
      in the online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are
      on video part 11, and there will undoubtedly be more parts in the
      future.&nbsp; Here is part 1:<br>
