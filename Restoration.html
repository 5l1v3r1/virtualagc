    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our

      provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the

      stay largely incomplete until the restoration has been completed

    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img alt="" src="restorationAGC.jpg" width="497"

        width="504" height="331"></p>
    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To my recollection I've never had any personal contact with
      Jimmie, but according to online information he worked in Project
      Apollo as a thermal vacuum test technician for LTA-8 (Lunar Test
      Article), among other things.&nbsp; LTA-8 was a LEM used only for
      testing and qualification purposes.&nbsp; He was thus in a good
      position years later to recognize the AGC when he saw it in a
      warehouse of junk that was intended to be scrapped for recycling
      purposes.&nbsp; After rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was
      eventually conceived of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was indeed used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8.&nbsp;
      This seems like a reasonable hypothesis since LTA-8's G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, #602, did use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no record of that AGC model
      having been used for any other purpose. In fact, the team has even
      been able to come up with some photographic evidence of this
      notion.&nbsp; Look at the photos below.<br>

    <p>Like any physical object, the restoration AGC has various
      discolorations, scratches, and so on ... "distinguishing marks",
      which should tell us if the photos above match each other.&nbsp;
      Of course, the restoration AGC is now 50 years older than it was
      in the LTA-8, and we know that it has <i>not</i> been treated as
      a national treasure in the meantime, so it's going to have a lot
      more distinguishing marks than it used to.&nbsp; We'll just pick
      one.&nbsp; The green circles in the photos above mark areas we're
      going to zoom in on in the enlarged photos below.&nbsp; Look for
      the triangular-shaped silvery area near the center of the
      pictures.<br>

    <p>In case you still can't see it, here's the same thing below, but

    <p>Which seems to confirm the team's thoughts:&nbsp; The restoration
      AGC is indeed the AGC from LTA-8!<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand .... it's very unlikely that this AGC was used
      <i>as-is</i> in such vacuum testing.&nbsp; In any kind of official
      testing, you typically want to use only devices whose
      configurations are <i>exactly</i> as documented, so that the
      entire testing configuration can be duplicated precisely later if
      the tests need to be repeated for some reason or if problems are
      discovered during testing. The restoration AGC, however, differs
      in some significant ways from the documented configuration for AGC
      p/n 2003100-071:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The AGC is missing its core-rope modules — i.e., the memory
        modules containing the AGC's software.&nbsp; Instead the
        restoration team has a rope simulator box, which as the name
        implies, is a way of providing the AGC with easily-changeable
        software without installing physical rope modules in it.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Some (indeed, most) circuit modules have not been "potted" —
        i.e., not filled up with sealant.&nbsp; Not everyone agrees with
        me that this is abnormal, however.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Module B11, the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE, has the wrong
        p/n:&nbsp; It should be 2003026-011 — indeed, <i>all</i> known
        configurations of AGC 2003100 used 2003026-011 — but it is
        actually 2003026-021 instead.&nbsp; In point of fact,
        2003026-021 was used in some AGC 2003200 configurations rather
        than in AGC 2003100.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Incidentally, if that all sounded like gibberish to you, you
      might find it valuable to look over <a
        href="ElectroMechanical.html#Basic_Partitioning_of_the_AGC">my
        explanation of the basic facts about the AGC's internal
        structure</a> before continuing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In other respects, though, the AGC is exactly as we would
      expect.&nbsp; Thus, a more accurate statement would be that this
      AGC was originally used in LTA-8 vacuum testing, but that a number
      of its circuit modules were subsequently swapped out and are no
      longer original to the unit.&nbsp; That wouldn't be unusual, by
      the way!&nbsp; Such repurposing happens all the time with
      engineering units that have fulfilled their primary purpose and
      have subsequently entered a second life as utility units. For
      example, I'm told that the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE mentioned above
      is one of a handful of modules in the AGC that had serious
      internal failures; once upon a time, it seems that someone with a
      broken AGC had raided the restoration AGC for its original working
      modules, leaving behind the broken ones.&nbsp; Back in the day,
      for engineering units that weren't going to be used on actual
      missions, that would have been much more expeditious than
      repairing the broken module.&nbsp; Repair is instead the
      unfortunate task now left to the restorers.&nbsp; More on that
      later.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In this case, though, it's downright <i>convenient</i> that some
      of the circuit modules have been swapped, since it would have been
      much harder for the restoration team to work with "potted" modules
      than with the unpotted modules the unit now contains.&nbsp; In
      fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the convenience factor hadn't
      been part of the motivation the original Apollo engineers had in
      swapping the modules in the first place!<br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as I mentioned above, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602,
      of which we have <a href="6014999-021.html">the engineering
        drawings</a>.&nbsp; Of course, those include the drawings for
      AGC p/n 2003100-071, but I've also split out <a
        href="2003100-071.html">the engineering drawings for AGC
        2003100-071</a> separately as a convenience.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Having the engineering drawings is how I knew, for example, that
      the p/n of module B11 was wrong.&nbsp; Well ... that and the fact
      that we also have photos of all the circuit modules in the
      restoration AGC, so we know exactly which part numbers and
      configurations they have, and thus can compare them to the
      engineering drawings.<br>

    <p>By "engineering drawings", of course, I mean the mechanical
      drawings and the electrical schematics.&nbsp; Other pertinent
      facts about G&amp;N system #602 are that it would have used DSKY
      model 2003985-081 (whose drawings are included in <a
        href="6014999-021.html#2003985-081">the G&amp;N engineering
        drawings)</a> and that the AGC would have been loaded with the
      AURORA software if the core rope modules had been present when
      Jimmie found the AGC.&nbsp; That's not a tragedy, though, because
      we <i>have</i> a copy of AURORA 12, and it can be run in the
      restoration AGC using the core rope simulator.&nbsp; If you're
      interested, you can view AURORA 12 in a variety of forms,
      including <a href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a
        pretty-printed transcription to source code</a>, or even run it
      in our AGC simulation software.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Whether 12 is the <i>exact</i> revision of the AURORA software
      for the restoration AGC isn't clear from the documentation
      available to us.&nbsp; In particular, our printout of AURORA 12
      doesn't have indicate a software part number as such printouts
      normally would, whereas the G&amp;N engineering drawings clearly
      indicate that we need software p/n "2021101-011".&nbsp; But AURORA
      12 is a software revision that would undoubtedly have functioned
      adequately in LTA-8.&nbsp; And it's the only AURORA we have.&nbsp;
      A significant fact about AURORA is that it includes a full suite
      of self-test software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software version to
      do so, since in later versions the self-test was greatly curtailed
      in order to save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus AURORA was typically
      the software used during Project Apollo itself to check out the
      AGC.</p>
    <p>As it so often seems to happen, the restoration team has actually
      independently come up with a forensic analysis that verifies that
      the software really <i>was</i> AURORA, but that it was <i>not</i>
      AURORA <i>12</i>.&nbsp; How, you may wonder, could they possibly
      have done that, considering that the AURORA software would have
      resided in the core ropes, and that the core ropes were not
      present?&nbsp; Well ... cleverly <img src="smiley.png" alt=""
        width="16" height="16">, so it's actually worth hearing
      about.&nbsp; The first thing to note is that the core ropes
      weren't the only type of memory in the AGC.&nbsp; The core ropes
      were manufactured in such a way that they contained fixed patterns
      of data — i.e., the program itself — which couldn't be changed by
      the AGC itself.&nbsp; But the AGC also contained erasable memory,
      which it could both write to and read from.&nbsp; Different
      versions of the AGC software inevitably ended up having different
      patterns of erasable memory usage, so if you know exactly what to
      look for in erasable memory, you could treat the patterns in
      erasable memory as a kind of "fingerprint" to determine which
      program had been stored in the core ropes the very last time the
      AGC had been in operation ... and assuming, of course, that the
      erasable-memory module had not been swapped with some other
      AGC!&nbsp; (Which, unfortunately, we do not know.)&nbsp; Perhaps
      most importantly, the restoration team stored the entire contents
      of the erasable memory module before they did anything that could
      possibly change the contents of memory, so they were in position
      to use this fingerprint information!<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="restorationDSPTAB.png" alt="" width="252" height="292"
        align="right">The specific pattern in erasable memory that the
      the team looked at is the so-called <tt>DSPTAB</tt>.&nbsp; It
      doesn't really matter what <tt>DSPTAB</tt> is, for the purpose of
      this explanation, but in case you're interested, it happens to to
      be an 11-word table in which <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/PINBALL_GAME__BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS.agc.html">the

        <tt>PINBALL GAME BUTTONS AND LIGHTS</tt> subprogram</a> keeps
      track of what is stored in all of the DSKY's internal relays, so
      that it knows not to waste time writing to those relays if the
      values haven't changed.&nbsp; The important thing to us at the
      moment, though, is that of all the many AGC software versions we
      know, only AURORA locates <tt>DSPTAB</tt> specifically at address
      0307 (octal) in erasable memory.&nbsp; And since the contents of <tt>DSPTAB</tt>
      are themselves DSKY-relay values, there should only be certain
      recognizable patterns stored in it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And indeed, that's what the team found:&nbsp; Stored at address
      0307 in erasable memory was a set of relay patterns.&nbsp; The
      image at right is a screenshot of a (simulated) DSKY into whose
      relays the <tt>DSPTAB</tt> table is loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other
      words, what you see is the very last thing the DSKY displayed the
      very last time the restoration AGC had been run back in the
      1960's.&nbsp; A ghost of the past!<br>
    </p>
    <p>In fact, the forensic analysis of the contents of erasable memory
      was much harder than I've made it sound, because <a
        href="#The_Problems">as we'll see later</a>, the erasable memory
      module is actually broken ... a matter which gave the team a lot
      of heartache before managing to work around the problem.<br>
    </p>
    <p>But as I mentioned, the software was not AURORA <i>12</i>.&nbsp;
      This is known because while <tt>DSPTAB</tt> is in the right
      place, other data is slightly out of place.&nbsp; Specifically,
      something called the "phase table" is one word higher in memory
      than it ought to be for AURORA 12.&nbsp; There is some reason to
      believe that the software may have been AURORA 88, though the
      reasoning (as I understand it anyway) becomes rather rarefied, and
      I won't trouble you with it.<br>
    </p>

      is the <i>only</i> software the restoration AGC can run.&nbsp; In

    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of videos about
      their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both in the
      online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are on
      video part 11, and there will undoubtedly be more parts in the

      align="right">Suppose you were handed an AGC and told to get it
    working.&nbsp; Since the AGC is a unique artifact that cannot be
    replaced, you obviously don't want to damage it by drilling holes in
    it, prying it apart, etc.&nbsp; Or at least, whatever you do to it
    needs to be minimally invasive.&nbsp; Beyond that, though, the steps
    involved aren't really much different than those an engineer needs
    to take if they had designed a device themselves and needed to power
    it up the first time.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, there's
    always something that doesn't work and needs to be debugged.<br>
    <br>
    So what are those steps?&nbsp; Well, to give you a general idea, if
    <i>I</i> had designed the AGC and was powering it up for the first
    time, I would have followed a series of steps something like this:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>I would have looked over the wiring to see if there was
        anything obviously amiss, such as obvious shorts or wires that
        had come loose.&nbsp; In the case of the restoration AGC, the
        wiring to look over would be the backplane wiring.&nbsp; And it
        would be well worth looking over, because it was entirely
        wire-wrapped.&nbsp; In wire-wrapping, objects to which an
        electrical connection need to be made — such as connector pins,
        pins of sockets into which electrical components are seated, and
        so on — have long metal posts.&nbsp; Insulation is stripped from
        the ends of wires, and then the uninsulated ends are wrapped
        tightly around the posts using a special tool.&nbsp; The image
        at near right, from Wikipedia, shows this generically.&nbsp; The
        image at far right shows it in a <i>very small</i> portion of
        the backplane of the restoration AGC.&nbsp; (Click to
        enlarge).&nbsp; Undoubtedly this sounds pretty wacky and
        unreliable if you're new to the technique, but back in the day,
        I recall reading technical articles claiming that wirewrapped
        connections were actually <i>more</i> reliable than soldered
        ones.&nbsp; Not that I ever really believed it ... but
        regardless of whether it's true or not, that's the way the AGC
        backplane is made.&nbsp; I have a pretty good idea that this
        inspection step must have been done by the restoration team,
        since Mike created a database of all the backplane connections,
        and <a href="http://apolloguidance.computer/2003100_071/pins">a
          nifty online backplane viewer</a> to go with it.&nbsp; What
        those do is to let you look at exactly how every connector pin
        on the backplane hooks up to every other backplane connector pin
        ... a real convenience, when look at the pictures above and
        think about just what a mess it would be to have to trace where
        the individual wires went!<br>
      </li>
      <li>I would then have inserted just the power-supply modules, A30
        and A31, and applied external power, to see that the proper
        internal voltages were being generated.&nbsp; Maybe I would even
        have put some dummy loads on them to make sure they could supply
        the proper current.&nbsp; Roughly speaking, the power-supply
        modules are supposed to accept +28 VDC from the spacecraft, and
        produce +4VDC and +14VDC for internal consumption in the
        AGC.&nbsp; This step, I think, the restoration team skipped and
        came back to later.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then I would probably have added the oscillator module, B7, to
        see if it could produce the proper 2.048 MHz clock signal. <a
href="http://rescue1130.blogspot.com/2018/11/restoring-apollo-guidance-computer-part.html">According




          to Carl Claunch's blog</a>, this is in fact the next thing
        they did.&nbsp; The reason they could do that without testing
        the power supply first is, of course, that they were capable of
        producing +4VDC and +14VDC themselves, using bench power
        supplies, and this didn't actually need to have the power supply
        modules plugged in.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Next I would have added the timer and scaler modules, A2 and
        A1.&nbsp; These have the responsibility to "divide" the 2.048
        MHz clock down to a lot of lower-frequency clock signals with
        various duty cycles and phase relationships.&nbsp; And
        similarly, Carl's blog indicates that this was the very next
        step they performed as well.<br>
      </li>
      <li>And so on ... <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>My intention with the procedure above is not to give you a
      blow-by-blow description of everything the restoration team did,
      but just to point out that there is a reasonable process that
      engineers are likely to follow, rather than just freaking out at
      the complexity of the problem. If you're truly interested in the
      blow-by-blow, however, I'd recommend following through on Carl's
      blog.<br>

    <p>What the team found as they proceeded was that things were not
      entirely rosy ... a <i>little</i> rosy, indeed <i>pretty</i>
      rosy, but not perfectly so.&nbsp; Most of the circuitry still
      worked!&nbsp; But not all of it, particularly among those modules
      that had been replaced, presumably <i>after</i> LTA-8
      testing.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, one reason that circuit
      modules may have been swapped afterward is that after its primary
      function (LTA-8 testing) had finished up, the AGC itself became a
      resource:&nbsp; It could be used as a source of spare parts.&nbsp;
      So if you were an engineer working with a different AGC and
      something on it broke, no problem!&nbsp; Just replace the broken
      module with a good (though likely older-model) one from the LTA-8
      AGC!&nbsp; As long as the AGC you were working with didn't end up
      in an actual mission, the fact that it had an obsolete (but
      functional!) circuit module or two was of no consequence to
      you.&nbsp; The unpleasant side-effect, of course, is that you end
      up with broken circuit modules in the restoration AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The team basically encountered only a few problems as they
      followed this path, and one of those had nothing to do with actual
      circuit breakage.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The connector pins.&nbsp; The team had a need to plug various
        things into the restoration AGC:&nbsp; a homemade rope
        simulator, a custom monitoring device (mimicking the original
        Ground Support Equipment), and so on.&nbsp; But the AGC
        connectors into which these things needed to be plugged required
        mating connectors that were no longer being manufactured.&nbsp;
        Of course, the temptation is to just find something that's close
        enough, and shove it in anyway.&nbsp; But that's not something
        you really do with an irreplaceable collector's item.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The scaler module, A1.&nbsp; The scalar module's function is
        pretty simple:&nbsp; It accepts a 102.4 KHz clock from the AGC
        backplane, and successively passes it through 33 separate
        divide-by-two circuits.&nbsp; In other words, a 102.4 KHz square
        wave comes in, and what goes out is a 51.2 KHz square wave, a
        25.6 KHz square wave, 12.8 KHz, 6.4 KHz, ..., 0.000011921
        Hz.&nbsp; That final output is so slow that it has a period of
        83886.08 seconds.&nbsp; Nearly an entire day!&nbsp; But not in
        the restoration AGC.&nbsp; The team found that divider stage 17
        was actually stuck high (at +4VDC) and therefore wasn't have the
        frequency output from stage 16.&nbsp; Thus divider stages 18
        through 33 also didn't output their desired square waves.</li>
      <li>The alarm module, B8.&nbsp; The alarm module also has a pretty
        simple function.&nbsp; It just has a bunch of little circuits,
        each one of which monitors and detects some simple failure
        condition, such as a voltage being wrong, a clock being stuck,
        etc.&nbsp; In point of fact, the team found that the former
        wasn't working quite right, and the module was sometimes (but
        not always) detecting that the +4VDC or +14VDC was out of the
        allowed range.</li>
      <li>The current-switch module, B11.&nbsp; TBD<br>
      </li>
      <li>The erasable-memory module, B12. This module provides what
        we'd today call the computer's "RAM".&nbsp; In other words, it's
        that portion of the computer's memory that can both be <i>written




          to</i> and <i>read from</i>.&nbsp; Like all of the memory in
        the AGC, the erasable module is based on ferrite-core
        technology.&nbsp; Each bit of memory is implemented with a
        ferrite core:&nbsp; a tiny, doughnut-shaped metal piece, with
        wires sewn (literally!) through the central hole.&nbsp; By
        passing current through some of these wires, the core can either
        be magnetized UP (bit=1) or DOWN (bit=0), and by using other of
        the wires, the value stored in the core can be read back by the
        CPU.&nbsp; Recall that the memory of the AGC is arranged in
        16-bit "words", of which 15 bits hold data, and the 16th is a
        parity bit that the AGC uses to detect a memory failure.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately, the team found that one of the wires (namely the
        "inhibit" signal) sewn through every bit-16 core was broken. The
        result is that one of the erasable memory bits, bit 16 is always
        stuck at 1 and can't be turned to 0.</li>

        align="right"></a>It may seem curious to you that I say the
    connector <i>pins</i> used in the AGC were no longer available nor
    being manufactured.&nbsp; Why don't I just say that the <i>connectors</i>
    are no longer available? <br>
    <br>
    That's because there were very few off-the-shelf connectors actually
    used in the AGC.&nbsp; Internally to the AGC, most of them were
    custom-made <i>headers</i> (as the engineering drawings refer to
    them).&nbsp; Consider, for example, the photo at the right, which
    shows the underside of a circuit module and the electrical pins by
    which it plugs into the backplane.&nbsp; The underside of the module
    is a metal plate into which hundreds of holes have been drilled, and
    into which an equal number of electrical pins have been
    inserted.&nbsp; The plate plus the pins is what's referred to as a
    "header".&nbsp; You can see this construction technique clearly if
    you click the image to enlarge it.&nbsp; The advantage of the
    technique, from the standpoint of the AGC designers was, I suppose,
    is that you can arrange the pins in any physical configuration you
    like, so it's much more flexible than if you had to work with
    off-the-shelf connectors.&nbsp; Besides, you can use the exact
    number of pins you want, and not be forced to stick with just
    standard-sized connectors, thus saving weight.&nbsp; And so
    on.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The downside to the team, 50 years later?&nbsp; No pins ... no
    header ... no nada!<br>
    <br>
    This was apparently a source of great frustration to the restoration
    team for months, until a couple of things came together to end up
    solving the problem.&nbsp; At first, even the <i>specifications</i>
    for these pins, manufactured by Malco, were unavailable.&nbsp; But
    it turns out that the specifications were eventually found, and you
    can see them here:<br>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    Next, it turns out that one of the core restoration team, Marc
    Verdiell, actually works for <a href="https://www.samtec.com/">Samtec</a>.&nbsp;



    Samtec is a major manufacturer of connectors, and indeed, back when
    I used to design electronics, practically every header I specified
    was from Samtec.&nbsp; Samtec apparently agreed to
    custom-manufacture hundreds of these Malco pins from the
    specifications, just for the restoration team's efforts.&nbsp; Check
    out a couple of the team's videos related to this:<br>

    Voila!&nbsp; Connector problem solved!<br>
    <h3><a name="The_Scaler_Module_A1"></a>The Scaler Module, A1<br>
    </h3>
    Fortunately, circuit module A1, the "scaler", is one of the unpotted
    ones, so the team was able to poke around inside it with multimeters
    to see what was happening.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    I believe the photo above (click to enlarge) is of module A1, though
    the stickers on the chips don't correspond with what I would
    expect.&nbsp; Frankly, it doesn't matter, since all of the so-called
    "logic flow" modules (A1, A2, A3, ...) look exactly the same, and
    there's no easy way to tell them apart visually.&nbsp; They differ
    only in the wires printed on the circuit boards, which you can't
    see, and the arrangement of the chips is always the same.&nbsp; You
    have to look at the electrical schematics to actually appreciate the
    great differences from one logic-flow module to the next.&nbsp;
    Module A1 takes this one step farther, and even the top and bottom
    sides of the modules have almost identical circuit schematics!<br>

    <br>
    Being able to poke around inside of the module, the team was quickly
    able to determine that there was a short circuit, probably caused by
    some stray bit of conductive material that had floated around and
    gotten stuck in the wrong place.<br>
    <br>
    They employed a fix that should be familiar to anybody familiar with
    the character called The Fonz on the old TV show <i>Happy Days</i>
    ... namely, they thumped it!&nbsp; Presumably the conductive
    particle was thus dislodged and went elsewhere, wherever it is that
    conductive particles go after we've lost interest in them.&nbsp; The
    module then began to work properly an continued to do so
    subsequently.<br>
    <br>
    Scaler problem solved!<br>
    <h3><a name="The_Alarm_Module_B8"></a>The Alarm Module, B8</h3>
    I don't know much about the restoration AGC's alarm module.&nbsp;
    Potted?&nbsp; Unpotted?&nbsp; It's TBD!&nbsp; All I have to show you
    is the module's spine, with its big, red <b><font color="#cc0000">NON-FLYABLE</font></b>
    warning.&nbsp; Do you think that might have something to do with why
    it doesn't work?<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src="restorationAlarmB8.jpg" alt=""
        width="780" height="90"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In the alarm module, as mentioned before, the problem is that its
    voltage-out-of-range detection circuitry is intermittent ...
    sometimes it shows the power-supply voltage as out-of-range, and
    sometimes not.&nbsp; However, the behavior appears to be
    characterized by whatever it does at power-up.&nbsp; In other words,
    if it detects a voltage failure at power-up, it will continue to do
    so until powered down.&nbsp; Conversely, if it doesn't detect a
    voltage failure at power-up, it won't detect one subsequently
    either.<br>
    <br>
    So the question is:&nbsp; does this problem even really need to be
    fixed?&nbsp; Wouldn't it just be acceptable to cycle power on the
    AGC if the problem showed up?&nbsp; Just like a "blue screen of
    death", for those familiar with the Microsoft Windows operating
    system.<br>
    <br>
    And that appears to be what the team decided to do.&nbsp; No fix,
    but an easy workaround!<br>

      B12!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Though not a part of the restoration team, I can feel the
      frustration myself.&nbsp; For one thing, while you can't actually
      do much with the AGC without a working erasable memory — after
      all, software's <i>raison d'être</i> is basically to manipulate
      the contents of memory, so if you can't do that, what can you do?
      —&nbsp; you nevertheless <i>can</i> do enough to convince
      yourself that the AGC would be almost completely operational if
      only the memory were there.&nbsp; Like Moses gazing across the
      River Jordan, you can see the Promised Land, but can't actually go
      there!&nbsp; You see, internally to the AGC, even getting the
      point where the first program instruction would be executed is a
      very complex operation that the AGC can execute flawlessly without
      memory, and which exercises almost every part of the CPU's
      circuitry.&nbsp; You can even execute the first few instructions,
      and can demonstrate that they work correctly other than their
      affect on the broken 16th memory bit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another frustrating part is that the erasable-memory module is
      one of the few <i>potted</i> modules, so that even if you can
      determine more-or-less where the broken wire is, you can't get to
      it to repair the break!&nbsp; That's not just because it's a
      collector's item and you don't want to rip it apart, but also
      because you cannot physically remove the potting material without
      destroying the circuit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At first, the team had the idea that if they could determine <i>precisely</i>
      where the <tt>INHIBIT</tt> wire was broken, then perhaps they
      could drill a small hole in the potting material to get access to
      it, and then perform some kind of microsurgery through the tiny
      hole to fix it.&nbsp; (This is the point where I had my sole
      involvement, in digging up the mechanical drawings for the
      physical configuration of the module, the specs for the potting
      material and so on.)&nbsp; Rather than relying on my lame
      descriptions, I'd recommend actually watching the team's video of
      their attempt to find the break, and why they concluded that the
      microsurgery idea couldn't work.<br>
    </p>

    Given that microsurgery was unworkable, another idea was that
    perhaps a completely new erasable-memory module could be made, and
    would be used to simply replace the broken module.&nbsp; That is an
    idea that would obviously work, though it would obviously reduce the
    authenticity somewhat, and would be quite a bit of effort.<br>
    <br>
    The idea eventually settled upon, though, as I understand it, was to
    exploit the existence of the parity bit to replace the missing 16th
    bit.&nbsp; As you may recall, the AGC memory, including the erasable
    memory, consists <i>logically</i> of 15-bit words — i.e., the
    software has access to 15 bits of every word of memory — but that <i>physically</i>
    there's a 16th bit, the "parity" bit.&nbsp; The parity bit is used
    by the AGC for detecting memory faults, by which I mean words of
    memory which have become corrupted.&nbsp; But regardless of how the
    AGC's CPU wants to use the parity data, from the standpoint of the
    erasable-memory module, the parity bit is simply a data bit just
    like any other data bit.&nbsp; Thus all it takes to use the parity
    bit in place of the broken data bit is to swap the connections for
    them on the backplane.&nbsp; Recall that the backplane is entirely
    wirewrapped, so changing such connections around is rather easy to
    do.&nbsp; Or at least, much easier to do than fixing the erasable
    memory module.&nbsp; Then later, presumably after the whole
    restoration process had finished up and the restoration AGC wants to
    return to being just another collector's item, the backplane
    connections would be restored to how they were originally ...
    broken, but corresponding to the the documentation!<br>
    <br>
    When I say that swapping the connections for the parity bit and the
    broken data bit are "all" that would be required, that's an
    oversimplification.&nbsp; Now all of the data bits would be fine,
    but the parity bit would be broken, so the AGC would continually be
    detecting memory faults ... or at least, detecting parity faults in
    roughly half the memory accesses.&nbsp; Dealing with this is TBD.<br>
