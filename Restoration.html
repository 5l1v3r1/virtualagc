    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our
      core developers did participate, and there is a certain synergy
      between the restoration effort and the Virtual AGC Project, so I
      think it is reasonable to give some information about the
      restoration effort here.&nbsp; If you see something bogus here,
      blame me and not the restorers!<br>
    </p>
    <p>As for this specific webpage, it is UNDER CONSTRUCTION and
      largely INCOMPLETE at the moment.&nbsp; My intention is not to
      provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the
      restoration, which I'm not capable of doing anyway, and so it will
      stay largely incomplete until the restoration has been completed
      ... which hasn't happened yet. <br>

    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>

    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To my recollection I've never had any personal contact with
      Jimmie, but according to online information he worked in Project
      Apollo as a thermal vacuum test technician for LTA-8 (Lunar Test
      Article), among other things.&nbsp; LTA-8 was a LEM used only for
      testing and qualification purposes.&nbsp; He was thus in a good
      position years later to recognize the AGC when he saw it in a
      warehouse of junk that was intended to be scrapped for recycling
      purposes.&nbsp; After rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was
      eventually conceived of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was indeed used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8.&nbsp;
      This seems like a reasonable hypothesis since LTA-8's G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, #602, did use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no record of that AGC model
      having been used for any other purpose. In fact, the team has even
      been able to come up with some photographic evidence of this
      notion.&nbsp; Look at the photos below.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Like any physical object, the restoration AGC has various
      discolorations, scratches, and so on ... "distinguishing marks",
      which should tell us if the photos above match each other.&nbsp;
      Of course, the restoration AGC is now 50 years older than it was
      in the LTA-8, and we know that it has <i>not</i> been treated as
      a national treasure in the meantime, so it's going to have a lot
      more distinguishing marks than it used to.&nbsp; We'll just pick
      one.&nbsp; The green circles in the photos above mark areas we're
      going to zoom in on in the enlarged photos below.&nbsp; Look for
      the triangular-shaped silvery area near the center of the
      pictures.<br>

    <p>In case you still can't see it, here's the same thing below, but

    <p>Which seems to confirm the team's thoughts:&nbsp; The restoration
      AGC is indeed the AGC from LTA-8!<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand .... it's very unlikely that this AGC was used
      <i>as-is</i> in such vacuum testing.&nbsp; In any kind of official
      testing, you typically want to use only devices whose
      configurations are <i>exactly</i> as documented, so that the
      entire testing configuration can be duplicated precisely later if
      the tests need to be repeated for some reason or if problems are
      discovered during testing. The restoration AGC, however, differs
      in some significant ways from the documented configuration for AGC
      p/n 2003100-071:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The AGC is missing its core-rope modules — i.e., the memory
        modules containing the AGC's software.&nbsp; Instead the
        restoration team has a rope simulator box, which as the name
        implies, is a way of providing the AGC with easily-changeable
        software without installing physical rope modules in it.&nbsp;
        (Besides, the rope simulator box itself contains parts
        manufactured after LTA-8 testing had occurred, so in the
        unlikely event that a rope simulator box had been used in LTA-8
        vacuum testing, it couldn't have been <i>this</i> rope
        simulator box, as-is.)<br>
      </li>
      <li> Some (indeed, most) circuit modules have not been "potted" —
        i.e., not filled up with sealant.</li>
      <li>Module B11, the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE, has the wrong
        p/n:&nbsp; It should be 2003026-011 — indeed, <i>all</i> known
        configurations of AGC 2003100 used 2003026-011 — but it is
        actually 2003026-021 instead.&nbsp; In point of fact,
        2003026-021 was used in some AGC 2003200 configurations rather
        than in AGC 2003100.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other respects, though, the AGC is exactly as we would
      expect.&nbsp; Thus, a more accurate statement would be that this
      AGC was originally used in LTA-8 vacuum testing, but that a number
      of its circuit modules were subsequently swapped out and are no
      longer original to the unit.&nbsp; That wouldn't be unusual, by
      the way!&nbsp; Such repurposing happens all the time with
      engineering units that have fulfilled their primary purpose and
      have subsequently entered a second life as utility units. For
      example, I'm told that the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE mentioned above
      is one of a handful of modules in the AGC that had serious
      internal failures; once upon a time, it seems that someone with a
      broken AGC had raided the restoration AGC for its original working
      modules, leaving behind the broken ones.&nbsp; Back in the day,
      for engineering units that weren't going to be used on actual
      missions, that would have been much more expeditious than
      repairing the broken module.&nbsp; Repair is instead the
      unfortunate task now left to the restorers.&nbsp; More on that
      later.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In this case, though, it's downright <i>convenient</i> that some
      of the circuit modules have been swapped, since it would have been
      much harder for the restoration team to work with "potted" modules
      than with the unpotted modules the unit now contains.&nbsp; In
      fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the convenience factor hadn't
      been part of the motivation the original Apollo engineers had in
      swapping the modules in the first place!<br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as I mentioned above, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602,
      of which we have <a href="6014999-021.html">the engineering
        drawings</a>, including the drawings for AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; That's how I knew, for example, that the p/n of
      module B11 was wrong.&nbsp; By "engineering drawings", of course,
      I mean the mechanical drawings and the electrical
      schematics.&nbsp; Other pertinent facts about G&amp;N system #602
      are that it would have used DSKY model 2003985-081 (whose drawings
      are also at the link just given) and that the AGC would have been
      loaded with the AURORA software.&nbsp; We have a copy of AURORA
      12, and you can view it in a variety of forms, including <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a pretty-printed
        transcription to source code</a>.&nbsp; Whether this is the <i>exact</i>
      revision of the software is unclear — AURORA 12 vs AURORA 11 or
      some other revision of AURORA —, because the documentation
      available to us doesn't extend to that level of detail.&nbsp; But
      AURORA 12 is a software revision that would undoubtedly have
      functioned adequately in LTA-8.&nbsp; And it's the only AURORA we
      have.&nbsp; A significant fact about AURORA is that it includes a
      full suite of self-test software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software
      version to do so, since in later versions the self-test was
      greatly curtailed in order to save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus
      AURORA was typically the software used during Project Apollo
      itself to check out the AGC.<br>

    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of youtube videos
      about their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both
      in the online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are
      on video part 11, and there will undoubtedly be more parts in the
      future.&nbsp; Here is part 1:<br>
