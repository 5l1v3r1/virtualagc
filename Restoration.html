    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our
      core developers did participate, and there is a certain synergy
      between the restoration effort and the Virtual AGC Project, so I
      think it is reasonable to give some information about the
      restoration effort here.&nbsp; If you see something bogus here,

      largely INCOMPLETE at the moment.&nbsp; My intention is not to
      provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the
      restoration, which I'm not capable of doing anyway, and so it will
      stay largely incomplete until the restoration has been completed
      ... which hasn't happened yet. <br>

    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>

    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To my recollection I've never had any personal contact with
      Jimmie, but according to online information he worked in Project
      Apollo as a thermal vacuum test technician for LTA-8 (Lunar Test
      Article), among other things.&nbsp; LTA-8 was a LEM used only for
      testing and qualification purposes.&nbsp; He was thus in a good
      position years later to recognize the AGC when he saw it in a
      warehouse of junk that was intended to be scrapped for recycling
      purposes.&nbsp; After rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was
      eventually conceived of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was indeed used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8.&nbsp;
      This seems like a reasonable hypothesis since LTA-8's G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, #602, did use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no record of that AGC model
      having been used for any other purpose. In fact, the team has even
      been able to come up with some photographic evidence of this
      notion.&nbsp; Look at the photos below.<br>

    <p>Like any physical object, the restoration AGC has various
      discolorations, scratches, and so on ... "distinguishing marks",
      which should tell us if the photos above match each other.&nbsp;
      Of course, the restoration AGC is now 50 years older than it was
      in the LTA-8, and we know that it has <i>not</i> been treated as
      a national treasure in the meantime, so it's going to have a lot
      more distinguishing marks than it used to.&nbsp; We'll just pick
      one.&nbsp; The green circles in the photos above mark areas we're
      going to zoom in on in the enlarged photos below.&nbsp; Look for
      the triangular-shaped silvery area near the center of the
      pictures.<br>

    <p>Which seems to confirm the team's thoughts:&nbsp; The restoration
      AGC is indeed the AGC from LTA-8!<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand .... it's very unlikely that this AGC was used
      <i>as-is</i> in such vacuum testing.&nbsp; In any kind of official
      testing, you typically want to use only devices whose
      configurations are <i>exactly</i> as documented, so that the
      entire testing configuration can be duplicated precisely later if
      the tests need to be repeated for some reason or if problems are
      discovered during testing. The restoration AGC, however, differs
      in some significant ways from the documented configuration for AGC
      p/n 2003100-071:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The AGC is missing its core-rope modules — i.e., the memory
        modules containing the AGC's software.&nbsp; Instead the
        restoration team has a rope simulator box, which as the name
        implies, is a way of providing the AGC with easily-changeable
        software without installing physical rope modules in it.&nbsp;
        (Besides, the rope simulator box itself contains parts
        manufactured after LTA-8 testing had occurred, so in the
        unlikely event that a rope simulator box had been used in LTA-8
        vacuum testing, it couldn't have been <i>this</i> rope
        simulator box, as-is.)<br>
      </li>
      <li> Some (indeed, most) circuit modules have not been "potted" —
        i.e., not filled up with sealant.&nbsp; Not everyone agrees with
        me that this is abnormal, however.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Module B11, the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE, has the wrong
        p/n:&nbsp; It should be 2003026-011 — indeed, <i>all</i> known
        configurations of AGC 2003100 used 2003026-011 — but it is
        actually 2003026-021 instead.&nbsp; In point of fact,
        2003026-021 was used in some AGC 2003200 configurations rather
        than in AGC 2003100.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other respects, though, the AGC is exactly as we would
      expect.&nbsp; Thus, a more accurate statement would be that this
      AGC was originally used in LTA-8 vacuum testing, but that a number
      of its circuit modules were subsequently swapped out and are no
      longer original to the unit.&nbsp; That wouldn't be unusual, by
      the way!&nbsp; Such repurposing happens all the time with
      engineering units that have fulfilled their primary purpose and
      have subsequently entered a second life as utility units. For
      example, I'm told that the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE mentioned above
      is one of a handful of modules in the AGC that had serious
      internal failures; once upon a time, it seems that someone with a
      broken AGC had raided the restoration AGC for its original working
      modules, leaving behind the broken ones.&nbsp; Back in the day,
      for engineering units that weren't going to be used on actual
      missions, that would have been much more expeditious than
      repairing the broken module.&nbsp; Repair is instead the
      unfortunate task now left to the restorers.&nbsp; More on that
      later.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In this case, though, it's downright <i>convenient</i> that some
      of the circuit modules have been swapped, since it would have been
      much harder for the restoration team to work with "potted" modules
      than with the unpotted modules the unit now contains.&nbsp; In
      fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the convenience factor hadn't
      been part of the motivation the original Apollo engineers had in
      swapping the modules in the first place!<br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as I mentioned above, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602,
      of which we have <a href="6014999-021.html">the engineering
        drawings</a>.&nbsp; Of course, those include the drawings for
      AGC p/n 2003100-071, but I've also split out <a
        href="2003100-071.html">the engineering drawings for AGC
        2003100-071</a> separately as a convenience.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Having the engineering drawings is how I knew, for example, that
      the p/n of module B11 was wrong.&nbsp; Well ... that and the fact
      that we also have photos of all the circuit modules in the
      restoration AGC, so we know exactly which part numbers and
      configurations they have, and thus can compare them to the
      engineering drawings.<br>

    <p>By "engineering drawings", of course, I mean the mechanical
      drawings and the electrical schematics.&nbsp; Other pertinent
      facts about G&amp;N system #602 are that it would have used DSKY
      model 2003985-081 (whose drawings are also at the link just given)
      and that the AGC would have been loaded with the AURORA software,
      if the core rope modules had been present when Jimmie found the
      AGC.&nbsp; That's not a tragedy, though, because we <i>have</i> a
      copy of AURORA 12, and it can be run in the restoration AGC using
      the core rope simulator.&nbsp; If you're interested, you can view
      AURORA 12 in a variety of forms, including <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a pretty-printed
        transcription to source code</a>, or even run it in our AGC
      simulation software.&nbsp; Whether this is the <i>exact</i>
      revision of the software for the restoration AGC is unclear —
      i.e., was it AURORA 12 vs AURORA 11 or some other revision of
      AURORA —, because the documentation available to us doesn't extend
      to that level of detail.&nbsp; But AURORA 12 is a software
      revision that would undoubtedly have functioned adequately in
      LTA-8.&nbsp; And it's the only AURORA we have.&nbsp; A significant
      fact about AURORA is that it includes a full suite of self-test
      software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software version to do so, since
      in later versions the self-test was greatly curtailed in order to
      save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus AURORA was typically the software
      used during Project Apollo itself to check out the AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Which isn't meant to imply that AURORA is the <i>only</i>
      software the restoration AGC can run.&nbsp; In fact, it should be
      capable of running essentially any of the Block II AGC software we
      have on our <a href="Luminary.html">LUMINARY</a> or <a
        href="Colossus.html">COLOSSUS</a> pages.<br>

    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of videos about
      their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both in the
      online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are on

      align="right">Suppose you were handed an AGC and told to get it
    working.&nbsp; Since the AGC is a unique artifact that cannot be
    replaced, you obviously don't want to damage it by drilling holes in
    it, prying it apart, etc.&nbsp; Or at least, whatever you do to it
    needs to be minimally invasive.&nbsp; Beyond that, though, the steps
    involved aren't really much different than those an engineer needs
    to take if they had designed a device themselves and needed to power
    it up the first time.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, there's
    always something that doesn't work and needs to be debugged.<br>
    <br>
    So what are those steps?&nbsp; Well, to give you a general idea, if
    <i>I</i> had designed the AGC and was powering it up for the first
    time, I would have followed a series of steps something like this:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>I would have looked over the wiring to see if there was
        anything obviously amiss, such as obvious shorts or wires that
        had come loose.&nbsp; In the case of the restoration AGC, the
        wiring to look over would be the backplane wiring.&nbsp; And it
        would be well worth looking over, because it was entirely
        wire-wrapped.&nbsp; In wire-wrapping, objects to which an
        electrical connection need to be made — such as connector pins,
        pins of sockets into which electrical components are seated, and
        so on — have long metal posts.&nbsp; Insulation is stripped from
        the ends of wires, and then the uninsulated ends are wrapped
        tightly around the posts using a special tool.&nbsp; The image
        at near right, from Wikipedia, shows this generically.&nbsp; The
        image at far right shows it in a <i>very small</i> portion of
        the restoration AGC.&nbsp; (Click to enlarge).&nbsp; Undoubtedly
        this sounds pretty wacky and unreliable if you're new to the
        technique, but back in the day, I recall reading technical
        articles claiming that wirewrapped connections were actually <i>more</i>
        reliable than soldered ones.&nbsp; Not that I ever really
        believed it ... but regardless of whether it's true or not,
        that's the way the AGC backplane is made.&nbsp; I have a pretty
        good idea that this inspection step must have been done by the
        restoration team, since Mike created a database of all the
        backplane connections, and <a
          href="http://apolloguidance.computer/2003100_071/pins">a nifty
          online backplane viewer</a> to go with it.</li>
      <li>I would have inserted just the power-supply modules, A30 and
        A31, and applied external power, to see that the proper internal
        voltages were being generated.&nbsp; Maybe I would even have put
        some dummy loads on them to make sure they could supply the
        proper current.&nbsp; Roughly speaking, the power-supply modules
        are supposed to accept +28 VDC from the spacecraft, and produce
        +4VDC and +14VDC for internal consumption in the AGC.&nbsp; This
        step, I think, the restoration team skipped and came back to
        later.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then I would probably have added the oscillator module, B7, to
        see if it could produce the proper 2.048 MHz clock signal. <a
href="http://rescue1130.blogspot.com/2018/11/restoring-apollo-guidance-computer-part.html">According
          to Carl Claunch's blog</a>, this is in fact the next thing
        they did.&nbsp; The reason they could do that without testing
        the power supply first is, of course, that they were capable of
        producing +4VDC and +14VDC themselves, using bench power
        supplies, and this didn't actually need to have the power supply
        modules plugged in.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Next I would have added the timer and scaler modules, A2 and
        A1.&nbsp; These have the responsibility to "divide" the 2.048
        MHz clock down to a lot of lower-frequency clock signals with
        various duty cycles and phase relationships.&nbsp; And
        similarly, Carl's blog indicates that this was the very next
        step they performed as well.<br>
      </li>
      <li>And so on ... <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>My intention with the procedure above is not to give you a
      blow-by-blow description of everything the restoration team did,
      but just to point out that there is a reasonable process that
      engineers are likely to follow, rather than just freaking out at
      the complexity of the problem. If you're truly interested in the
      blow-by-blow, however, I'd recommend following through on Carl's
      blog.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="The_Problems"></a>The Problems<br>
    </h2>
    <p>What the team found as they proceeded was that things were not
      entirely rosy ... a <i>little</i> rosy, indeed <i>pretty</i>
      rosy, but not perfectly so.&nbsp; Most of the circuitry still
      worked!&nbsp; But not all of it, particularly among those modules
      that had been replaced, presumably <i>after</i> LTA-8
      testing.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, one reason that circuit
      modules may have been swapped afterward is that after its primary
      function (LTA-8 testing) had finished up, the AGC itself became a
      resource:&nbsp; It could be used as a source of spare parts.&nbsp;
      So if you were an engineer working with a different AGC and
      something on it broke, no problem!&nbsp; Just replace the broken
      module with a good (though likely older-model) one from the LTA-8
      AGC!&nbsp; As long as the AGC you were working with didn't end up
      in an actual mission, the fact that it had an obsolete (but
      functional!) circuit module or two was of no consequence to
      you.&nbsp; The unpleasant side-effect, of course, is that you end
      up with broken circuit modules in the restoration AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The team basically encountered only four problems as they
      followed this path, and only three of those had anything to do
      with actual circuit breakage.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The connector pins.&nbsp; The team had a need to plug various
        things into the restoration AGC:&nbsp; a homemade rope
        simulator, a custom monitoring device (mimicking the original
        Ground Support Equipment), and so on.&nbsp; But the AGC
        connectors into which these things needed to be plugged required
        mating connectors — indeed, connector-pin and -receptacle <i>sizes</i>
        — that were no longer being manufactured.&nbsp; Of course, the
        temptation is to just find something that's close enough, and
        shove it in anyway.&nbsp; But that's not something you really do
        with an irreplaceable collector's item.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The scaler module, A1.&nbsp; The scalar module's function is
        pretty simple:&nbsp; It accepts a 102.4 KHz clock from the AGC
        backplane, and successively passes it through 33 separate
        divide-by-two circuits.&nbsp; In other words, a 102.4 KHz square
        wave comes in, and what goes out is a 51.2 KHz square wave, a
        25.6 KHz square wave, 12.8 KHz, 6.4 KHz, ..., 0.000011921
        Hz.&nbsp; That final output is so slow that it has a period of
        83886.08 seconds.&nbsp; Nearly an entire day!&nbsp; But not in
        the restoration AGC.&nbsp; The team found that divider stage 17
        was actually stuck high (at +4VDC) and therefore wasn't have the
        frequency output from stage 16.&nbsp; Thus divider stages 18
        through 33 also didn't output their desired square waves.</li>
      <li>The alarm module, B8.&nbsp; The alarm module also has a pretty
        simple function.&nbsp; It just has a bunch of little circuits,
        each one of which monitors and detects some simple failure
        condition, such as a voltage being wrong, a clock being stuck,
        etc.&nbsp; In point of fact, the team found that the former
        wasn't working quite right, and the module was sometimes (but
        not always) detecting that the +4VDC or +14VDC was out of the
        allowed range.</li>
      <li>The erasable-memory module, B12. This module provides what
        we'd today call the computer's "RAM".&nbsp; In other words, it's
        that portion of the computer's memory that can both be <i>written
          to</i> and <i>read from</i>.&nbsp; Like all of the memory in
        the AGC, the erasable module is based on ferrite-core
        technology.&nbsp; Each bit of memory is implemented with a
        ferrite core:&nbsp; a tiny, doughnut-shaped metal piece, with
        wires sewn (literally!) through the central hole.&nbsp; By
        passing current through some of these wires, the core can either
        be magnetized UP (bit=1) or DOWN (bit=2), and by using other of
        the wires, the value stored in the core can be read back by the
        CPU.&nbsp; Recall that the memory of the AGC is arranged in
        16-bit "words", of which 15 bits hold data, and the 16th is a
        parity bit that the AGC uses to detect a memory failure.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately, the team found that one of the wires (namely the
        "inhibit" signal) sewn through every bit-16 core was broken. The
        result is that one of the erasable memory bits, bit 16 is always
        stuck at 1 and can't be turned to 0.<br>
