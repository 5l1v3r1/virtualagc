    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our
      core developers did participate, and there is a certain synergy
      between the restoration effort and the Virtual AGC Project, so I
      think it is reasonable to give some information about the
      restoration effort here.&nbsp; If you see something bogus here,
      blame me and not the restorers!<br>
    </p>
    <p>As for this specific webpage, it is UNDER CONSTRUCTION and
      largely INCOMPLETE at the moment.&nbsp; My intention is not to
      provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the
      restoration, which I'm not capable of doing anyway, and so it will
      stay largely incomplete until the restoration has been completed
      ... which hasn't happened yet. <br>

    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I have not been in contact with Jimmie (I think), but according
      to online information, he worked in Project Apollo as a thermal
      vacuum test technician for LTA-8 (Lunar Test Article), among other
      things.&nbsp; He was thus in a good position years later to
      recognize the AGC when he saw it in a warehouse of junk that was
      intended to be scrapped for recycling purposes.&nbsp; After
      rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was eventually conceived
      of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was indeed used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8.&nbsp;
      This seems like a reasonable hypothesis since LTA-8's G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, #602, did use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no record of that AGC model
      having been used for any other purpose.&nbsp; On the other hand,
      there are several things about this particular AGC that we
      wouldn't expect if the team's hypothesis were literally true:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the circuit modules in the AGC is dated 1970, and thus
        would not even have been built yet when LTA-8 testing was
        ongoing.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> Some modules have not been "potted" — i.e., not filled up
        with sealant — which is not something that would be likely for a
        unit used in environmental testing.</li>
      <li>Module B11, the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE, has the wrong
        p/n:&nbsp; it should be 2003026-011 — indeed, <i>all</i> known
        configurations of AGC 2003100 used 2003026-011 — but it is
        actually 2003026-021 instead.&nbsp; In point of fact,
        2003026-021 was used in some AGC 2003200 configurations rather
        than in AGC 2003100.&nbsp; Such a substitution would be very
        unlikely if qualification testing was taking place.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus if this AGC had indeed originally been used in LTA-8 vacuum
      testing, a number of its modules must have been swapped out later
      and aren't original to the unit ... which is certainly a
      possibility and does not disprove the team's hypothesis.&nbsp;
      Such repurposing happens all the time with engineering units that
      have fulfilled their primary purpose and have entered a second
      life as utility units. <br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as I mentioned above, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602,
      of which we have <a href="6014999-021.html">the engineering
        drawings</a>, including the drawings for AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; That's how I knew, for example, that the p/n of
      module B11 was wrong.&nbsp; By "engineering drawings", of course,
      I mean the mechanical drawings and the electrical
      schematics.&nbsp; Other pertinent facts about G&amp;N system #602
      are that it would have used DSKY model 2003985-081 (whose drawings
      are also at the link just given) and that the AGC would have been
      loaded with the AURORA software.&nbsp; We have a copy of AURORA
      12, and you can view it in a variety of forms, including <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a pretty-printed
        transcription to source code</a>.&nbsp; Whether this is the <i>exact</i>
      version of the software is unclear, but it is a version that would
      undoubedly have functioned adequately in LTA-8.&nbsp; A
      significant fact about AURORA is it includes a full suite of
      self-test software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software version to do
      so, since in later versions the self-test was greatly curtailed in
      order to save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus AURORA was typically the
      software used during Project Apollo itself to check out the AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of youtube videos
      about their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both
      in the online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are
      on video part 11, and there will undoubtedly be more parts in the
      future.&nbsp; Here is part 1:<br>
