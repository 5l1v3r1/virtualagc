    <p>The Virtual AGC Project was <i>not</i> involved in the
      AGC-restoration project described herein.&nbsp; But one of our
      core developers did participate, and there is a certain synergy
      between the restoration effort and the Virtual AGC Project, so I
      think it is reasonable to give some information about the
      restoration effort here.&nbsp; If you see something bogus here,
      blame me and not the restorers!<br>

    <p>As for this specific webpage, it is under construction and is
      still somewhat incomplete at the moment.&nbsp; My intention is not
      to provide an up-to-the-minute accounting of the progress of the
      restoration, which I'm not capable of doing anyway, and so it will
      stay incomplete until the restoration has been completed ... which
      hasn't entirely happened yet. <br>

    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>What <i>is</i> "The Restoration"?<br>
    </h1>
    <p>"The Restoration" is an attempt to power up and run one of the
      original Apollo Guidance Computers.&nbsp; I'm told (in 2019) that
      there is presently no other AGC in operation in the world.<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img alt="" src="restorationAGC.jpg" width="497"

          border="2"></a>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="pnTagAGC.jpg"
        width="504" height="331"></p>
    <p>Specifically, this is an attempt to operate one particular Block
      II AGC:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>Part number: 2003100-071<br>
        Serial number:&nbsp; (Raytheon) 14<br>
        Owner:&nbsp; Jimmie Loocke</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To my recollection I've never had any personal contact with
      Jimmie, but according to online information he worked in Project
      Apollo as a thermal vacuum test technician for LTA-8 (Lunar Test
      Article), among other things.&nbsp; LTA-8 was a LEM used only for
      testing and qualification purposes.&nbsp; He was thus in a good
      position years later to recognize the AGC when he saw it in a
      warehouse of junk that was intended to be scrapped for recycling
      purposes.&nbsp; After rescuing the AGC from its fate, the idea was
      eventually conceived of actually restoring it and operating it.<br>

    <p>While this AGC never flew a mission, the restoration team
      believes it was indeed used in the vacuum testing of LTA-8.&nbsp;
      This seems like a reasonable hypothesis since LTA-8's G&amp;N
      (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, #602, did use an AGC p/n
      2003100-071.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no record of that AGC model
      having been used for any other purpose. In fact, the team has even
      been able to come up with some photographic evidence of this
      notion.&nbsp; Look at the photos below.<br>

    <p>Like any physical object, the restoration AGC has various
      discolorations, scratches, and so on ... "distinguishing marks",
      which should tell us if the photos above match each other.&nbsp;
      Of course, the restoration AGC is now 50 years older than it was
      in the LTA-8, and we know that it has <i>not</i> been treated as
      a national treasure in the meantime, so it's going to have a lot
      more distinguishing marks than it used to.&nbsp; We'll just pick
      one.&nbsp; The green circles in the photos above mark areas we're
      going to zoom in on in the enlarged photos below.&nbsp; Look for
      the triangular-shaped silvery area near the center of the
      pictures.<br>

    <p>Which seems to confirm the team's thoughts:&nbsp; The restoration
      AGC is indeed the AGC from LTA-8!<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand .... it's very unlikely that this AGC was used
      <i>as-is</i> in such vacuum testing.&nbsp; In any kind of official
      testing, you typically want to use only devices whose
      configurations are <i>exactly</i> as documented, so that the
      entire testing configuration can be duplicated precisely later if
      the tests need to be repeated for some reason or if problems are
      discovered during testing. The restoration AGC, however, differs
      in some significant ways from the documented configuration for AGC
      p/n 2003100-071:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The AGC is missing its core-rope modules — i.e., the memory
        modules containing the AGC's software.&nbsp; Instead the
        restoration team has a rope simulator box, which as the name
        implies, is a way of providing the AGC with easily-changeable
        software without installing physical rope modules in it.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Some (indeed, most) circuit modules have not been "potted" —
        i.e., not filled up with sealant.&nbsp; Not everyone agrees with
        me that this is abnormal, however.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Module B11, the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE, has the wrong
        p/n:&nbsp; It should be 2003026-011 — indeed, <i>all</i> known
        configurations of AGC 2003100 used 2003026-011 — but it is
        actually 2003026-021 instead.&nbsp; In point of fact,
        2003026-021 was used in some AGC 2003200 configurations rather
        than in AGC 2003100.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Incidentally, if that all sounded like gibberish to you, you
      might find it valuable to look over <a
        href="ElectroMechanical.html#Basic_Partitioning_of_the_AGC">my
        explanation of the basic facts about the AGC's internal
        structure</a> before continuing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In other respects, though, the AGC is exactly as we would
      expect.&nbsp; Thus, a more accurate statement would be that this
      AGC was originally used in LTA-8 vacuum testing, but that a number
      of its circuit modules were subsequently swapped out and are no
      longer original to the unit.&nbsp; That wouldn't be unusual, by
      the way!&nbsp; Such repurposing happens all the time with
      engineering units that have fulfilled their primary purpose and
      have subsequently entered a second life as utility units. For
      example, I'm told that the CURRENT SWITCH MODULE mentioned above
      is one of a handful of modules in the AGC that had serious
      internal failures; once upon a time, it seems that someone with a
      broken AGC had raided the restoration AGC for its original working
      modules, leaving behind the broken ones.&nbsp; Back in the day,
      for engineering units that weren't going to be used on actual
      missions, that would have been much more expeditious than
      repairing the broken module.&nbsp; Repair is instead the
      unfortunate task now left to the restorers.&nbsp; More on that
      later.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In this case, though, it's downright <i>convenient</i> that some
      of the circuit modules have been swapped, since it would have been
      much harder for the restoration team to work with "potted" modules
      than with the unpotted modules the unit now contains.&nbsp; In
      fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the convenience factor hadn't
      been part of the motivation the original Apollo engineers had in
      swapping the modules in the first place!<br>
    </p>
    <p>By the way, as I mentioned above, LTA-8 used G&amp;N system #602,
      of which we have <a href="6014999-021.html">the engineering
        drawings</a>.&nbsp; Of course, those include the drawings for
      AGC p/n 2003100-071, but I've also split out <a
        href="2003100-071.html">the engineering drawings for AGC
        2003100-071</a> separately as a convenience.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Having the engineering drawings is how I knew, for example, that
      the p/n of module B11 was wrong.&nbsp; Well ... that and the fact
      that we also have photos of all the circuit modules in the
      restoration AGC, so we know exactly which part numbers and
      configurations they have, and thus can compare them to the
      engineering drawings.<br>

    <p>By "engineering drawings", of course, I mean the mechanical
      drawings and the electrical schematics.&nbsp; Other pertinent
      facts we can glean from the engineering drawings for G&amp;N
      system #602 are that it would have used DSKY model 2003985-081
      (whose drawings are included in <a
        href="6014999-021.html#2003985-081">the G&amp;N engineering
        drawings)</a> and that the AGC would have been loaded with the
      AURORA 85 software if the core rope modules had been present when
      Jimmie found the AGC.&nbsp; Actually, to be pedantic about it, the
      engineering drawings tell us only that AURORA software having a
      part number of 2021101-011 would have been installed, while <a
href="https://ia800609.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/1/items/acelectroniclmma00acel/acelectroniclmma00acel_jp2.zip&amp;file=acelectroniclmma00acel_jp2/acelectroniclmma00acel_0217.jp2&amp;scale=1&amp;rotate=90">Table




        3-IJ of document ND-1021042</a> tells us additionally that:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Software p/n 2021101-011 = AURORA 85</li>
      <li>Software p/n 2021101-021 or 2021101-031 = AURORA 88<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other corroborating evidence comes from <a
        href="hrst/archive/967.pdf">MIT's final report</a>.&nbsp;
      Chapter 10.1.3 of the report covers system testing using
      AURORA.&nbsp; It mentions only AURORA 85 (of which it says 5 sets
      of rope modules were manufactured) and an improved revision,
      AURORA 88 (of which it says 4 sets were manufactured).&nbsp; All
      things considered, it seems as though the only revisions of AURORA
      for which rope modules were manufactured were 85 and 88.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Alas, we have no copy of AURORA 85 software, nor of AURORA
      88.&nbsp; But we have something pretty close, namely AURORA 12,
      and it can be run in the restoration AGC using the core rope
      simulator.&nbsp; If you're interested, you can view AURORA 12 in a
      variety of forms, including <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/MAIN.agc.html">a pretty-printed
        transcription to source code</a>, or even run it in our AGC
      simulation software.&nbsp; And have no fear, AURORA 12 is a
      software revision that would undoubtedly have functioned
      adequately in LTA-8.&nbsp; Not to mention that it's the only
      AURORA revision we have the actual source code for.&nbsp; A
      significant fact about AURORA is that it includes a full suite of
      self-test software ... the <i>last</i> AGC software version to do
      so, since in later versions the self-test was greatly curtailed in
      order to save precious memory.&nbsp; Thus AURORA was typically the
      software used during Project Apollo itself to check out the AGC.</p>
    <p>Of course, the question of what software <i>should</i><i> have
        been</i> installed in the restoration AGC and what software <i>actually




        was</i> installed in the AGC the last time it had rope modules
      are two different questions!<br>
    </p>
    <p>As it turns out, we're pretty sure that some revision of AURORA
      was indeed the last set of ropes installed, but which don't know
      which AURORA revision other than that it was <i>not</i> AURORA
      12.&nbsp; That's a pretty sweeping statement, considering that we
      don't have the original rope modules!&nbsp; How could anybody know
      for sure?&nbsp; Well, the conclusion comes from a clever forensic
      analysis by the restoration team, which goes something like
      this:&nbsp; The first thing to note is that the core ropes weren't
      the <i>only</i> type of memory in the AGC.&nbsp; The core ropes,
      by definition, are manufactured in such a way that they contain
      fixed patterns of data — i.e., the program itself — which couldn't
      be changed by the AGC itself.&nbsp; But the AGC also contained
      erasable memory, which it could both write to and read from.&nbsp;
      Different versions of the AGC software in the core ropes
      inevitably ended up having different patterns of erasable memory
      usage when the software ran, so if you knew exactly what to look
      for in erasable memory, you could treat the patterns in erasable
      memory as a kind of "fingerprint" to determine which program had
      been stored in the core ropes the very last time the AGC had been
      in operation.&nbsp; (Assuming of course that the erasable memory
      module hadn't been swapped out from a different AGC in the
      meantime!)&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, the restoration team
      stored the entire contents of the erasable memory module before
      they did anything that could possibly change the contents of
      memory, so they were in position to use this fingerprint
      information!<br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="restorationDSPTAB.png" alt="" width="252" height="292"
        align="right">The specific pattern in erasable memory that the
      the team looked at is the so-called <tt>DSPTAB</tt>.&nbsp; It
      doesn't really matter what <tt>DSPTAB</tt> is, for the purpose of
      this explanation, but in case you're interested, it happens to to
      be an 11-word table in which <a
        href="listings/Aurora12/PINBALL_GAME__BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS.agc.html">the







        <tt>PINBALL GAME BUTTONS AND LIGHTS</tt> subprogram</a> keeps
      track of what is stored in all of the DSKY's internal relays, so
      that it knows not to waste time writing to those relays if the
      values haven't changed.&nbsp; The important thing to us at the
      moment, though, is that of all the many AGC software versions we
      know, only AURORA locates <tt>DSPTAB</tt> specifically at address
      0307 (octal) in erasable memory.&nbsp; And since the contents of <tt>DSPTAB</tt>
      are themselves DSKY-relay values, there should only be certain
      recognizable patterns stored in it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>And indeed, that's what the team found:&nbsp; Stored at address
      0307 in erasable memory was a set of relay patterns.&nbsp; The
      image at right is a screenshot of a (simulated) DSKY into whose
      relays the <tt>DSPTAB</tt> table is loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other
      words, what you see is the very last thing the DSKY displayed the
      very last time the restoration AGC had been run back in the
      1960's.&nbsp; A ghost of the past!<br>
    </p>
    <p>In fact, the forensic analysis of the contents of erasable memory
      was much harder than I've made it sound, because <a
        href="#The_Problems">as we'll see later</a>, the erasable memory
      module is actually broken ... a matter which gave the team a lot
      of heartache before managing to work around the problem.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As for why it could not have been AURORA 12 — other than the fact
      that we think no rope modules were ever made for AURORA 12 —, we
      know this for sure because while <tt>DSPTAB</tt> is in the right
      place in erasable memory, other data is slightly out of
      place.&nbsp; Specifically, something called the "phase table" is
      one word higher in memory than it ought to be for AURORA 12.&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, one fun tidbit about the erasable memory is that Nik
      Beug (not a restoration team member) had the opportunity to dig
      through the dump of the erasable-memory module, and found that one
      of the erasable-memory locations, <tt>LATITUDE</tt>, decoded to
      29.553223°N±0.02°.&nbsp; The value should correspond to the last
      place the AGC had been run, assuming it had a functioning Inertial
      Measurement Unit (IMU).&nbsp; The latitude of Johnson Space
      Center, according to Google Maps, is 29.559560°N.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, the ±0.02° uncertainty (due to <tt>LATITUDE</tt>
      being stored as a single-precision floating-point number rather
      than a double-precision one) is too large to allow pinpointing the
      exact building. &nbsp;<img alt="" src="smiley.png" width="16"
        height="16"> </p>
    <p>By the way, all the talk above about AURORA isn't meant to imply
      that AURORA is the <i>only</i> software the restoration AGC can
      run.&nbsp; In fact, it should be capable of running essentially
      any of the Block II AGC software we have on our <a
        href="Luminary.html">LUMINARY</a> or <a href="Colossus.html">COLOSSUS</a>
      pages.&nbsp; Actually, the team has told me that, in fact, they
      had tested every AGC software version we have, and that all of
      them did run fine on the restoration AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The restoration team has made an ongoing series of videos about
      their activity, thus gaining a measure of recognition both in the
      online and real worlds.&nbsp; As I'm writing this, they are on
      video part 11, and there will undoubtedly be more parts in the
      future.&nbsp; Here is part 1:<br>

      align="right">Suppose you were handed an AGC and told to get it
    working.&nbsp; Since the AGC is a unique artifact that cannot be
    replaced, you obviously don't want to damage it by drilling holes in
    it, prying it apart, etc.&nbsp; Or at least, whatever you do to it
    needs to be minimally invasive.&nbsp; Beyond that, though, the steps
    involved aren't really much different than those an engineer needs
    to take if they had designed a device themselves and needed to power
    it up the first time.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, there's
    always something that doesn't work and needs to be debugged.<br>
    <br>
    So what are those steps?&nbsp; Well, here's a very brief summary of
    the process the restoration team followed.&nbsp; It won't be
    everybody's cup of tea, so you should feel free to skip past if your
    eyes start to glaze over.&nbsp; The basic point I want to get
    across, though, is the systematic nature of the process.&nbsp; It's
    not magic.&nbsp; If you can get the power supplies and the clock
    signals all working, you're well on your way to getting a working
    unit; if your power supplies or clock signals don't work, you have
    nothing.&nbsp; And check modules in isolation from each other
    wherever possible, so that the failure of one doesn't break
    others.&nbsp; Divide and conquer.&nbsp; Those are the kinds of
    philosophies you can see in the team's procedure.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Look over the wiring to see if there is anything obviously
        amiss, such as obvious shorts or wires that had come
        loose.&nbsp; In the case of the restoration AGC, the wiring to
        look over would be the backplane wiring.&nbsp; And it would be
        well worth looking over, because it was entirely
        wire-wrapped.&nbsp; In wire-wrapping, objects to which an
        electrical connection need to be made — such as connector pins,
        pins of sockets into which electrical components are seated, and
        so on — have long metal posts.&nbsp; Insulation is stripped from
        the ends of wires, and then the uninsulated ends are wrapped
        tightly around the posts using a special tool.&nbsp; The image
        at near right, from Wikipedia, shows this generically.&nbsp; The
        image at far right shows it in a <i>very small</i> portion of
        the backplane of the restoration AGC.&nbsp; (Click to
        enlarge).&nbsp; Undoubtedly this sounds pretty wacky and
        unreliable if you're new to the technique, but back in the day,
        I recall reading technical articles claiming that wirewrapped
        connections were actually <i>more</i> reliable than soldered
        ones.&nbsp; Not that I ever really believed it ... but
        regardless of whether it's true or not, that's the way the AGC
        backplane is made.&nbsp; As a part of this process, Mike created
        a database of all the backplane connections, and <a
          href="http://apolloguidance.computer/2003100_071/pins">a nifty
          online backplane viewer</a> to go with it.&nbsp; What those do
        is to let you look at exactly how every connector pin on the
        backplane hooks up to every other backplane connector pin ... a
        real convenience, when look at the pictures above and think
        about just what a mess it would be to have to trace where the
        individual wires went!</li>
      <li>A kind of electronic component called a capacitor, and
        particularly electrolytic or tantalum capacitors, tends to
        degrade and fail over time, sometimes even blowing up and
        leaving a nice, little charred area and a distinctive
        smell.&nbsp; Often when the monitor on your computer fails —
        assuming you're so old-fashioned as to have a "computer" or a
        "monitor" — it's due to the fact that some capacitors have
        failed, and you may be able to find cheap capacitor kits to
        perform repairs.&nbsp; In the case of the restoration AGC, of
        course, the team preferred not to have any such failures, and
        thus proactively checked every tantalum capacitor in the AGC. </li>
      <li>Check the oscillator module, B7, to see if it can produce the
        proper 2.048 MHz clock signal.&nbsp; The reason they could do
        that without testing the power supply first is, of course, that
        they were capable of producing +4VDC and +14VDC themselves,
        using bench power supplies, and this didn't actually need to
        have the power supply modules plugged in.</li>
      <li>Check the power-supply modules, A30 and A31, to see that they
        can generate the proper voltages.&nbsp; Roughly speaking, the
        power-supply modules are supposed to accept +28 VDC from the
        spacecraft, and produce +4VDC and +14VDC for internal
        consumption in the AGC.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>Check the various "logic modules", A1, A2, A3, etc.&nbsp; In
        my view, the most fundamental of the logic modules are the timer
        and scaler modules, A2 and A1, because without them, basically
        none of the other modules can work.&nbsp; These have the
        responsibility to "divide" the 2.048 MHz clock down to a lot of
        lower-frequency clock signals with various duty cycles and phase
        relationships. At any rate, modules A1, A2, and A3 were checked
        very thoroughly, with each input and output of each gate being
        checked individually.&nbsp; That, as you can imagine, becomes
        very tiring very quickly, so the remainder of the logic modules
        were given a once-over-lightly treatment, just to make sure they
        weren't going to overheat and blow up.</li>
      <li>Test the alarm module, B8, since it provides the essential
        functionality of properly sequencing certain power-up
        operations.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Power up the AGC with all of the modules checked above ... and
        none of the ones (most of the Tray B modules) that haven't been
        checked yet.</li>
      <li>Check out each of the remaining modules, in isolation.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you're managed to get this far, you're probably truly
      interested in the technical nitty-gritty.&nbsp; I might suggest
      reading farther on <a

    <p>What the team found as they proceeded was that things were not
      entirely rosy ... a <i>little</i> rosy, indeed <i>pretty</i>
      rosy, but not perfectly so.&nbsp; Most of the circuitry still
      worked!&nbsp; But not all of it, particularly among those modules
      that had been replaced, presumably <i>after</i> LTA-8
      testing.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, one reason that circuit
      modules may have been swapped afterward is that after its primary
      function (LTA-8 testing) had finished up, the AGC itself became a
      resource:&nbsp; It could be used as a source of spare parts.&nbsp;
      So if you were an engineer working with a different AGC and
      something on it broke, no problem!&nbsp; Just replace the broken
      module with a good (though likely older-model) one from the LTA-8
      AGC!&nbsp; As long as the AGC you were working with didn't end up
      in an actual mission, the fact that it had an obsolete (but
      functional!) circuit module or two was of no consequence to
      you.&nbsp; The unpleasant side-effect, of course, is that you end
      up with broken circuit modules in the restoration AGC.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The team basically encountered only a few problems as they
      followed this path, and one of those had nothing to do with actual
      circuit breakage.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The connector pins.&nbsp; The team had a need to plug various
        things into the restoration AGC:&nbsp; a homemade rope
        simulator, a custom monitoring device (mimicking the original
        Ground Support Equipment), and so on.&nbsp; But the AGC
        connectors into which these things needed to be plugged required
        mating connectors that were no longer being manufactured.&nbsp;
        Of course, the temptation is to just find something that's close
        enough, and shove it in anyway.&nbsp; But that's not something
        you really do with an irreplaceable collector's item.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The scaler module, A1.&nbsp; The scalar module's function is
        pretty simple:&nbsp; It accepts a 102.4 KHz clock from the AGC
        backplane, and successively passes it through 33 separate
        divide-by-two circuits.&nbsp; In other words, a 102.4 KHz square
        wave comes in, and what goes out is a 51.2 KHz square wave, a
        25.6 KHz square wave, 12.8 KHz, 6.4 KHz, ..., 0.000011921
        Hz.&nbsp; That final output is so slow that it has a period of
        83886.08 seconds.&nbsp; Nearly an entire day!&nbsp; But not in
        the restoration AGC.&nbsp; The team found that divider stage 17
        was actually stuck high (at +4VDC) and therefore wasn't half the
        frequency output from stage 16.&nbsp; Thus divider stages 18
        through 33 also didn't output their desired square waves.</li>
      <li>The alarm module, B8.&nbsp; The alarm module also has a pretty
        simple function.&nbsp; It just has a bunch of little circuits,
        each one of which monitors and detects some simple failure
        condition, such as a voltage being wrong, a clock being stuck,
        etc.&nbsp; In point of fact, the team found that the former
        wasn't working quite right, and the module was sometimes (but
        not always) detecting that the +4VDC or +14VDC was out of the
        allowed range.</li>
      <li>The current-switch module, B11.&nbsp; TBD<br>
      </li>
      <li>The erasable-memory module, B12. This module provides what
        we'd today call the computer's "RAM".&nbsp; In other words, it's
        that portion of the computer's memory that can both be <i>written










          to</i> and <i>read from</i>.&nbsp; Like all of the memory in
        the AGC, the erasable module is based on ferrite-core
        technology.&nbsp; Each bit of memory is implemented with a
        ferrite core:&nbsp; a tiny, doughnut-shaped metal piece, with
        wires sewn (literally!) through the central hole.&nbsp; By
        passing current through some of these wires, the core can either
        be magnetized UP (bit=1) or DOWN (bit=0), and by using other of
        the wires, the value stored in the core can be read back by the
        CPU.&nbsp; Recall that the memory of the AGC is arranged in
        16-bit "words"; of those 16, one is a parity bit that the AGC
        uses to detect a memory failure and the other fifteen hold
        data.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the team found that one of the wires
        (namely the "inhibit" signal) sewn through every bit-16 core was
        broken. The result is that one of the erasable memory bits, bit
        16, is always stuck at 1 and can't be turned to 0.</li>

        align="right"></a>It may seem curious to you that I say the
    connector <i>pins</i> used in the AGC were no longer available nor
    being manufactured.&nbsp; Why don't I just say that the <i>connectors</i>
    are no longer available? <br>
    <br>
    That's because there were very few off-the-shelf connectors actually
    used in the AGC.&nbsp; Internally to the AGC, most of them were
    custom-made <i>headers</i> (as the engineering drawings refer to
    them).&nbsp; Consider, for example, the photo at the right, which
    shows the underside of a circuit module and the electrical pins by
    which it plugs into the backplane.&nbsp; The underside of the module
    is a metal plate into which hundreds of holes have been drilled, and
    into which an equal number of electrical pins have been
    inserted.&nbsp; The plate plus the pins is what's referred to as a
    "header".&nbsp; You can see this construction technique clearly if
    you click the image to enlarge it.&nbsp; The advantage of the
    technique, from the standpoint of the AGC designers was, I suppose,
    is that you can arrange the pins in any physical configuration you
    like, so it's much more flexible than if you had to work with
    off-the-shelf connectors.&nbsp; Besides, you can use the exact
    number of pins you want, and not be forced to stick with just
    standard-sized connectors, thus saving weight.&nbsp; And so
    on.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The downside to the team, 50 years later?&nbsp; No pins ... no
    header ... no nada!<br>
    <br>
    This was apparently a source of great frustration to the restoration
    team for months, until a couple of things came together to end up
    solving the problem.&nbsp; At first, even the <i>specifications</i>
    for these pins, manufactured by Malco, were unavailable.&nbsp; But
    it turns out that the specifications were eventually found, and you
    can see them here:<br>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    Next, it turns out that one of the core restoration team, Marc
    Verdiell, actually works for <a href="https://www.samtec.com/">Samtec</a>.&nbsp;









    Samtec is a major manufacturer of connectors, and indeed, back when
    I used to design electronics, practically every header I specified
    was from Samtec.&nbsp; Samtec apparently agreed to
    custom-manufacture hundreds of these Malco pins from the
    specifications, just for the restoration team's efforts.&nbsp; Check
    out a couple of the team's videos related to this:<br>

    </ul>
    Voila!&nbsp; Connector problem solved!<br>
    <h3><a name="The_Scaler_Module_A1"></a>The Scaler Module, A1<br>
    </h3>
    Fortunately, circuit module A1, the "scaler", is one of the unpotted
    ones, so the team was able to poke around inside it with multimeters
    to see what was happening.<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><a href="restorationA1.jpg"><img

          width="733" height="159" border="2"></a><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    I believe the photo above (click to enlarge) is of module A1, though
    the stickers on the chips don't correspond with what I would
    expect.&nbsp; Frankly, it doesn't matter, since all of the so-called
    "logic flow" modules (A1, A2, A3, ...) look exactly the same, and
    there's no easy way to tell them apart visually.&nbsp; They differ
    only in the wires printed on the circuit boards, which you can't
    see, and the arrangement of the chips is always the same.&nbsp; You
    have to look at the electrical schematics to actually appreciate the
    great differences from one logic-flow module to the next.&nbsp;
    Module A1 takes this one step farther, and even the top and bottom
    sides of the modules have almost identical circuit schematics!<br>

    Being able to poke around inside of the module, the team was quickly
    able to determine that there was a short circuit, probably caused by
    some stray bit of conductive material that had floated around and
    gotten stuck in the wrong place.<br>
    <br>
    They employed a fix that should be familiar to anybody familiar with
    the character called The Fonz on the old TV show <i>Happy Days</i>
    ... namely, they thumped it!&nbsp; Presumably the conductive
    particle was thus dislodged and went elsewhere, wherever it is that
    conductive particles go after we've lost interest in them.&nbsp; The
    module then began to work properly an continued to do so
    subsequently.<br>

    I don't know much about the restoration AGC's alarm module.&nbsp;
    Potted?&nbsp; Unpotted?&nbsp; It's TBD!&nbsp; All I have to show you
    is the module's spine, with its big, red <b><font color="#cc0000">NON-FLYABLE</font></b>
    warning.&nbsp; Do you think that might have something to do with why
    it doesn't work?<br>
    <br>

    </div>
    <br>
    In the alarm module, as mentioned before, the problem is that its
    voltage-out-of-range detection circuitry is intermittent ...
    sometimes it shows the power-supply voltage as out-of-range, and
    sometimes not.&nbsp; However, the behavior appears to be
    characterized by whatever it does at power-up.&nbsp; In other words,
    if it detects a voltage failure at power-up, it will continue to do
    so until powered down.&nbsp; Conversely, if it doesn't detect a
    voltage failure at power-up, it won't detect one subsequently
    either.<br>
    <br>
    One advantageous thing the team found is that the problem is
    particularly apparent when the module is testing in <i>isolation</i>.&nbsp;




    Once the entire AGC is loaded up with all its modules, the problem
    basically goes away!&nbsp; Which is not to say that the module works
    perfectly, for there are still conditions which can trigger the
    problem, but they occur much less frequently.<br>
    <br>
    So the question is:&nbsp; does this problem even really need to be
    fixed?&nbsp; Wouldn't it just be acceptable to cycle power on the
    AGC if the problem showed up?&nbsp; Just like a "blue screen of
    death", for those familiar with the Microsoft Windows operating
    system.<br>
    <br>
    And that appears to be what the team decided to do.&nbsp; No fix,
    but an easy workaround!<br>

    <p>Which finally brings us to the elephant in the room, the problem
      that seems to have caused the most frustration for the longest
      period of time:&nbsp; The dreaded broken erasable-memory module,
      B12!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Though not a part of the restoration team, I can feel the
      frustration myself.&nbsp; For one thing, while you can't actually
      do much with the AGC without a working erasable memory — after
      all, software's <i>raison d'être</i> is basically to manipulate
      the contents of memory, so if you can't do that, what can you do?
      —&nbsp; you nevertheless <i>can</i> do enough to convince
      yourself that the AGC would be almost completely operational if
      only the memory were there.&nbsp; Like Moses gazing across the
      River Jordan, you can see the Promised Land, but can't actually go
      there!&nbsp; You see, internally to the AGC, even getting the
      point where the first program instruction would be executed is a
      very complex operation that the AGC can execute flawlessly without
      memory, and which exercises almost every part of the CPU's
      circuitry.&nbsp; You can even execute the first few instructions,
      and can demonstrate that they work correctly other than their
      affect on the broken 16th memory bit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another frustrating part is that the erasable-memory module is
      one of the few <i>potted</i> modules, so that even if you can
      determine more-or-less where the broken wire is, you can't get to
      it to repair the break!&nbsp; That's not just because it's a
      collector's item and you don't want to rip it apart, but also
      because you cannot physically remove the potting material without
      destroying the circuit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At first, the team had the idea that if they could determine <i>precisely</i>
      where the <tt>INHIBIT</tt> wire was broken, then perhaps they
      could drill a small hole in the potting material to get access to
      it, and then perform some kind of microsurgery through the tiny
      hole to fix it.&nbsp; (This is the point where I had my sole
      involvement, in digging up the mechanical drawings for the
      physical configuration of the module, the specs for the potting
      material and so on.)&nbsp; Rather than relying on my lame
      descriptions, I'd recommend actually watching the team's video of
      their attempt to find the break, and why they concluded that the
      microsurgery idea couldn't work.<br>
    </p>

      </iframe></p>
    Given that microsurgery was unworkable, another idea was that
    perhaps a completely new erasable-memory module could be made, and
    would be used to simply replace the broken module.&nbsp; That is an
    idea that would obviously work, though it would obviously reduce the
    authenticity somewhat, and would be quite a bit of effort.<br>
    <br>
    The idea eventually settled upon, though, as I understand it, was to
    exploit the existence of the parity bit to replace the missing 16th
    bit.&nbsp; As you may recall, the AGC memory, including the erasable
    memory, consists <i>logically</i> of 15-bit words — i.e., the
    software has access to 15 bits of every word of memory — but that <i>physically</i>
    there's a 16th bit, the "parity" bit.&nbsp; The parity bit is used
    by the AGC for detecting memory faults, by which I mean words of
    memory which have become corrupted.&nbsp; But regardless of how the
    AGC's CPU wants to use the parity data, from the standpoint of the
    erasable-memory module, the parity bit is simply a data bit just
    like any other data bit.&nbsp; Thus all it takes to use the parity
    bit in place of the broken data bit is to swap the connections for
    them on the backplane.&nbsp; Recall that the backplane is entirely
    wirewrapped, so changing such connections around is rather easy to
    do.&nbsp; Or at least, much easier to do than fixing the erasable
    memory module.&nbsp; Then later, presumably after the whole
    restoration process had finished up and the restoration AGC wants to
    return to being just another collector's item, the backplane
    connections would be restored to how they were originally ...
    broken, but corresponding to the the documentation!<br>
    <br>
    When I say that swapping the connections for the parity bit and the
    broken data bit are "all" that would be required, that's an
    oversimplification.&nbsp; Now all of the data bits would be fine,
    but the parity bit would be broken, so the AGC would continually be
    detecting memory faults ... or at least, detecting parity faults in
    roughly half the memory accesses.&nbsp; Taking care of this little
    detail actually turns out to be quite easy:&nbsp; There's a
    backplane signal called <tt>TPGE</tt> which, when grounded, simply
    disables the CPU's parity check for the erasable memory
    module!&nbsp; So that's what the team did.&nbsp; (Parity checking
    for the core ropes, if there were any, is controlled by a different
    backplane signal, <tt>TPGF</tt>, but the team had no reason to
    disable that functionality).<br>
    <br>
    Given the frustration this problem seems to have caused, the
    relatively-trivial solution almost seems like an anticlimax.<br>
    <br>
    So ... not a fix, but a relatively easy workaround, albeit one that
    eventually needs to be undone to return the AGC to its pristine but
    broken state!<br>
    <h1><a name="Core_Ropes"></a>The Core Ropes</h1>
    <p>So, if you've followed the explanations above, you realize that
      Jimmie Loocke and the restoration team now have a basically
      restored AGC that is actually functioning, even though it has no
      core-rope modules of its own.&nbsp; What else can you do with it?<br>
    </p>
    <p>You can do some trading!&nbsp; Or in the parlance of the day, you
      can negotiate a deal.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Huh?&nbsp; What kind of deal?&nbsp; Well, for one thing, if
      you've paid any attention at all to the things you've seen on this
      website, you'll have realized that I'm mainly interested in
      preserving the <i>software</i> of the AGC for future generations
      and for the academic interest of understanding how the AGC
      software evolved over time.&nbsp; But getting AGC software is a
      tough proposition, since it usually depends on people who have
      such stuff stepping forward and giving it to you.&nbsp; There
      aren't that many people who can (or sometimes, sadly, who <i>will</i>)
      do that.&nbsp; But wait, is there any way this nifty, now-restored
      AGC can somehow be exploited to get some AGC software for us?<br>
    </p>
    <p>It turns out that there is!&nbsp; How effective it will be over
      the course of time I don't know, but it works something like
      this:&nbsp; There are various museums and even private collectors
      who have AGCs.&nbsp; While those AGCs probably wouldn't function
      if powered up, some of them may have core-rope modules in
      them.&nbsp; And if you visit a museum/collector, taking along your
      own now-functioning AGC, perhaps the museum/collector let you <i>temporarily</i>
      install their own rope modules in your AGC, so perhaps you can
      read the contents of those modules ... i.e., perhaps you can get
      copies of the software the AGCs belonging to those museums or
      collectors contain.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The fruits of that kind of wheeling-and-detailing (none of it by
      <i>me</i>, of course, since I'm not a participant in the
      restoration) are covered in the subsections below.<br>

    Museum in Mountain View, California, has an AGC.&nbsp; Their AGC has
    core-rope modules installed in it, and those core-rope modules

    Perhaps you may recall from <a href="Luminary.html">our LUMINARY

        <i>Restoration team's AGC with Computer History Museum's<br>

          The right-hand module, B1, has some defects.<br>
        </i> </div>
    </center>
    <br>
    But nothing is ever easy, because module B1 is broken in a way
    similar to the way the restoration AGC's erasable-memory module,
    B12, is also broken.&nbsp; In this case, two of the strands in the
    rope braid are defective, with the result being that in the first
    half of memory bank 0 bit 14 is always stuck HIGH, while in the
    first half of bank 4 bit 3 is usually stuck HIGH (but oddly is also
    sometimes erroneously LOW).&nbsp; The readings are repeatable.<br>
    <br>
    What saves us in terms of being able to recover the program,
    however, is a characteristic of parity bits that is not used by the
    AGC itself.<br>
    <br>
    As you recall, the memory in the AGC is arranged in 16-bit "words",
    each word consisting of 15 "data" bits and 1 "parity" bit.&nbsp; For
    the uninitiated, how the parity bit works is something like this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>In the 15 data bits, count up how many of them are 1 and how
        many of them are 0.</li>
      <li>The parity bit has been set (at manufacturing time) to be
        whichever value it needs to be (1 or 0) to make the total number
        of 1-bits <i>odd</i>.&nbsp; For example, if the data bits were
        000000000000000, then the parity bit would set to 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The AGC itself uses this information merely to detect if there
      has been memory corruption:&nbsp; If any <i>single</i> data bit
      in a word has been corrupted, so that it has flipped from 0 to 1
      or vice-versa, then the parity bit is wrong; the AGC can detect
      the wrong parity bit.&nbsp; If two bits in a word have flipped,
      then the parity doesn't change and the error can't be detected ...
      but that's a much lower probability event, so the parity bit
      provides pretty reliable detection of errors in most cases.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In our case, though, we can use the parity bit to actually <i>fix</i>
      the broken memory bits!&nbsp; I mean, we can fix them in the data
      file dumped from the core rope, and not in the physical core rope
      itself.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>How so?&nbsp; Well, in the case of the data read from the
      Computer History Museum's core-ropes, we know that only a single
      bit in some words is bad, and we know <i>which</i> bit it is, as
      well.&nbsp; So all we need to do is to set those known-bad bits
      (bit 14 in bank 0 or bit 3 in bank 4) in such a way as to make the
      total number of 1-bits in each word odd.&nbsp; Simple!&nbsp; (Or
      at least, simple for a computer! <img alt="" src="smiley.png"
        width="16" height="16">)&nbsp; If two of the bits in any of the
      words had been bad, we couldn't fix them this way (or at all!),
      but with just one bad bit per word it works out perfectly.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Even so, that's not enough to give us confidence in the
      data.&nbsp; For example, what about the fact that a random bit
      here or there might have been corrupted sitting around the last 50
      years or so?&nbsp; Those errors would normally be detected by
      parity errors!&nbsp; Well, we can still use parity checking for
      all of the core memory not affected by the systematic
      errors.&nbsp; I mean, parity checking in all of the other memory
      banks (other than banks 0 and 4) or in the 2nd halves of banks 0
      and 4 is still just as useful as ever.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another feature that would normally give us confidence is bank
      checksums:&nbsp; In most AGC programs, each memory bank is
      accompanied by a checksum word (basically the sum of all of the
      other words in the bank), so if the checksum isn't consistent with
      the other words in the bank, it's an easy way to detect
      errors.&nbsp; Unfortunately, RETREAD is such an early program that
      it didn't yet use bank checksums.&nbsp; So that's a
      double-checking method that simply isn't available to us.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another method of providing confidence of the data dumped from
      the core ropes is to see if meaningful software source code can be
      created for it.&nbsp; After all, the data dumped from the ropes is
      just a series of numbers, the so-called "assembled" form of the
      software source code.&nbsp; As such, it's nice to have and can be
      used to run the program, but it's not really usefully
      human-readable.&nbsp; Only the source code is readable, even even
      if you need to be one of the illuminati to do so, so we really
      want source code.&nbsp; One thing that assists in attempting to
      come up with such source code is that RETREAD 50 is obviously
      going to be <i>very similar</i> to RETREAD 44, for which we
      already have the source code.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, the restoration team has gone through exactly this
      exercise, by modifying RETREAD 44's source code as necessary to
      get source code for RETREAD 50 than can, in turn, be assembled to
      get precisely the (repaired) data dumped from the core
      ropes.&nbsp; Not only that, I've been given a concise executive
      summary of the differences between the two:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new erasable location had been added to store the <tt>FB</tt>
        register in case of any self-test errors; previously only the <tt>Q</tt>
        register was saved in SFAIL.</li>
      <li>DCA and I/O self-tests that failed in RETREAD 44 were
        corrected.</li>
      <li><tt>T4RUPT</tt> was sped up to 50ms, from 120ms. This is
        interesting because they went back to 120ms for AURORA, unless
        DSKY updates are pending, in which case they do 20. Presumably
        they tried 50 as a compromise and didn't like it.</li>
      <li>PINBALL now supports its first 5 extended verbs. Two of them
        are coarse align and fine align; most or all all seem IMU/CDU
        related.</li>
      <li>Lots of new code for interfacing with the IMU/CDU is present
        in memory bank 11, which was previously empty. The coarse align
        stuff is nearly identical to AURORA 12, and thus the source code
        for it was salvaged from AURORA 12. The fine align code started
        that way and then diverged.&nbsp; The rest of bank 11, however,
        has not yet been matched to anything in other existing source
        code, and thus variable names and program labels in it have been
        assigned arbitrarily.&nbsp; That doesn't affect the validity of
        the code, but it does make it less useful for giving is
        confidence in it.<br>
      </li>
