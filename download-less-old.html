for Binary-Package Installation<br></h2>Obviously, I'm not in a
position to test on every platform known to man, but the
following represents my beliefs based on the testing I've been
able do do.&nbsp; Note that when I say that Virtual AGC "works"
on a given platform, it may still be subject to some <a href=
"#Some_platform-specific_odditities">limitations or reduced
functionality</a> in some areas.<br><ul><li>All platforms:&nbsp; Install <a href=
"http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> if not already installed.&nbsp;
I don't know how pervasive a problem it is—i.e., which
operating systems or versions of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tck/Tk</span> it affects—but in recently
trying to install <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> on Microsoft Vista, I found
that the installation program does not create a file called
"wish.exe", but instead creates a file called
"wish85.exe".&nbsp; This prevents certain features of Virtual
AGC from working.&nbsp; In the case of Windows Vista, I fixed
it by duplicating the file "c:\tcl\bin\wish85.exe" and calling
the duplicate "c:\tcl\bin\wish.exe".&nbsp; Sorry about this,
but I don't honestly see what I can do about it.<br></li><li>Linux:&nbsp; The <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">X-Window</span> system, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">xterm</span>, and <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gtk+</span> libraries must be
installed.<br></li><li>Operating systems:</li><ul><li>Mac OS X:&nbsp;<br></li><ul><li>10.4 and later, Intel and PowerPC, are believed to
work.<br></li><li>10.2 or prior is known <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
work.</li></ul><li>Windows:</li><ul><li>XP is known to work.</li><li>Vista and Windows 7 are known to work but <a href=
"#Some_platform-specific_odditities">various
workarounds</a> need to be applied and some patience may be
needed.<br></li><li>Windows 98 or prior is known <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
work.</li><li>Only 32-bit systems were tried; the behavior on 64-bit
systems is unknown.<br></li><li>Others (2000) are untried and unknown.<br></li></ul><li>Linux 'x86:</li><ul><li>Fedora Core 4 and later versions are believed to work;
Fedora Core 1 is known <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> to
work.<br></li><li>Ubuntu 7.04 and later versions are believed to
work.</li><li>SuSE 10.1 and later versions are believed to work.</li><li>Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems seem okay.<br></li><li>Other distributions and earlier versions of those
listed above: untried and unknown.</li></ul><li>FreeBSD:</li><ul><li>Currently, I am working only with PC-BSD 7.1, which is
based on FreeBSD 7.2.&nbsp; In the past it worked also with
PC-BSD 7.02, which is based on FreeBSD 7.1.&nbsp; There is
no binary package for this platform, but if built from
source it seems to work.<br></li></ul><li>OpenSolaris:</li><ul><li>Currently, I am working only with OpenSolaris
0811.&nbsp; There is no binary package for this platform,
but if built from source it partially works.&nbsp; I'm not
satisfied with it at this point.<br></li></ul></ul></ul><h2><a name=Downloads id="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>The
development snapshot is versioned, and all released snapshots
remain available perpetually in the <a href=
"Downloads/">archive</a>.&nbsp;
However, for economy, binary downloads are not versioned and
simply are current with the latest development snapshot.&nbsp;
The GitHub repository represents a separate source tree that was
forked at some point into a subversion repository at Google Code,
then merged back in May 2009, and then finally converted to a
GitHub repository when Google Code ceased active operation;
therefore, all development snapshots after May 2009 can be found
in the GitHub repository, but not prior to that time.<br><br><table summary="" style=

Unlike previous Linux installers, this is not intended to
be<br>
generic with respect to the version of Linux.&nbsp; It was
specifically<br>
built for Linux Mint 17.3, and therefore hopefully
works<br>
Ubuntu 14.04 and later as well.&nbsp; Nevertheless, your
experience<br>
may vary.<br><br>
Nor is the installer self-contained.&nbsp; You may or may
not still need<br>
to install some additional packages from your Linux
version's<br>
repository to make it work, such as:&nbsp; libsdl,
libncurses5,<br>

called <a style="font-weight: bold;" href=
"http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a> which I
haven't written, but which is available under the GNU GPL
license.&nbsp; If you so desire, you can download the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> source code
for the version whose binary is being provided by <a href=
"Downloads/terminator-source.tar.gz">
clicking here</a>.&nbsp; I have neither modified nor recompiled
this code.&nbsp; Neither the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> source code nor binary is
versioned as provided here, because the files <span style=
"font-style: italic;">I</span> downloaded were not versioned by
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> project
itself.<br><br>
You should note, by the way, that alternate installation options
might be available at now-archival-only <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/">Google Code page</a> for
certain specific computer configurations. (Whereas my "standard"
install focuses almost entirely on wide cross-platform
consistency.) While I won't try to track those alternate packages
in detail here, I'm aware that (for example) there's a 64-bit
Fedora 12 RPM there that's consistent with the 201000220
snapshot.&nbsp; I'm told by Onno Hommes that the following
advantages can be expected from using the RPM rather than my
"standard" install:<br><ul><li>Installation is faster and better-behaved if some auxiliary
requirements like Tcl/Tk aren't installed.</li><li>Better compliance to Linux standards, such as installation
under /opt.</li><li>Better permissions settings for some files.</li><li>Easier upgrade.<br></li></ul><h2><a name=InstallBinary id="InstallBinary"></a>Installing

may not be marked as "executable" after download, so please
change its desktop-icon properties permissions to "executable",
or else do "chmod +x VirtualAGC-installer" from the command
line.) Simply run the installation program, which is <span style=

will be obvious to you.&nbsp; A desktop icon called "Virtual AGC"
will be installed unless you deselect it.&nbsp; Additionally, a
program group will be placed on your Gnome or KDE start menu
called "Virtual AGC", and it will contain both the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> program and an uninstaller
program. (I'm not sure what happens in alternate desktop
environments like XFCE.)&nbsp; On some systems the start menu may
not be immediately updated and therefore you may not see the
"Virtual AGC" program group until you log in the next time.<br><br>

Note to FreeBSD users:&nbsp; You may anticipate that the Linux
version of Virtual AGC can be installed, due to the optional
Linux compatibility layer of FreeBSD.&nbsp; I would not recommend
it, since (in my experiments) it worked just enough to give you a
false sense of hope, but not enough to do anything useful.&nbsp;

stuff requiring manual setup)<br></h2><h3><a name=Source_Highlighting id=
"Source_Highlighting"></a>AGC/AEA Source-Code Syntax
Highlighting</h3>Onno Hommes has developed AGC and AEA specific
syntax-highlighting extensions for various editing programs often
used for developing software source code:&nbsp; <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Kate</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">KWrite</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Kdevelop</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Eclipse</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">vim</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">TextPad</span>, and (maybe) <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">emacs</span>. &nbsp; Although there's no
real way to integrate this feature with Virtual AGC software
proper, each of the available downloads (source-code development
snapshot and Linux/Win32/Mac binary installers) do provide the
appropriate configuration files for updating the various
text-editing programs.&nbsp; There is also a file called
EnableSyntaxAGC.odt included there which contains instructions
for doing so.&nbsp; (At present, you may want to use the free
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> office
suite to read this file.)&nbsp;<br><br>
For a binary installation, the files just mentioned can be found
under the installation directory (typically
"~/VirtualAGC/Resources/SyntaxHighlight" in Linux, "c:\Program
Files\Virtual AGC\Resources\SyntaxHighlight" in Windows, and
"~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources/SyntaxHighlight" in
Mac OS X).&nbsp; For a development snapshot, look in
"yaAGC/Contributed/SyntaxHighlight".<br><br>
Here's a nice screenshot (click to enlarge) of what source
highlighting looks like in <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Kdevelop</span>.&nbsp; As you can see, it's
a lot more pleasant to read the AGC source code with the
highlighting than without it.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="SyntaxAGC-Kdevelop.jpg"><img style=
"border: 2px solid ; width: 300px; height: 240px;" alt=
"Screenshot of source highlighting in KDevelop" title=
"Click to enlarge" src="SyntaxAGC-Kdevelop-thumb.jpg" height=
"240" width="300" border="0"></a></div><br>
Of course, syntax highlighting is also provided when browsing
AGC/AEA source code from the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI—thanks to enhancements
to the assemblers prompted by seeing Onno's text-editor
extensions in action—but the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI syntax-highlighting
depends on having previously assembled the programs and does not
provide developmental editing of the source code.
<h3><a name=Debugging id="Debugging"></a>gdb-compatible AGC/AEA
debugging</h3>Onno has also done a lot of work on changing the
debugging options of the AGC and AEA simulations—i.e., the
ability to debug AGC and AEA assembly-language code—from the
original methods I conceived to a <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>-compatible method in which
<span style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span> commands and GUI
front-ends like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kdbg</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>, or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EMACS</span> could be
used.&nbsp; This is largely working.&nbsp; The official
explanation is maintained by Onno at <a href=
"http://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/">the separate website Onno
has set up</a>.&nbsp;<br><h4><a name="One-time_setup_procedure_for" id=
"One-time_setup_procedure_for"></a>One-time setup procedure for
Code::Blocks</h4>What follows is my explanation of the minimum
one-time setup steps needed to make CUI-based debugging via
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> work
directly with the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI.&nbsp; With some luck,
we may be able to eventually provide scripts to automate the
setup, but for now it's a manual procedure.&nbsp; <span style=
"font-style: italic;">Note that I'm describing work in progress,
and so my description may not yet be fully accurate</span>.<br><br>
In the explanation that follows, we'll need to refer to the
folder in which Virtual AGC is installed, which differs from
platform to platform and according to your installation or build
choices.&nbsp; By default, the installation directory will be
something like:.
<ul><li>For a default Linux binary installation:&nbsp;
"~/VirtualAGC".</li><li>For a default Win32 binary installation:&nbsp; "c:\Program
Files\Virtual AGC".</li><li>For a default Mac OS X binary installation:&nbsp;
"~/VirtualAGC.app/Contents".</li><li>For a native build from source code, it's more complex, but
could be:&nbsp; "yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC".</li></ul>For simplicity we'll just refer to it as <span style=
"font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>.&nbsp; Also, we'll always
pretend for simplicity that the character '/' is used as a path
separator, even though it is really '\' on Windows.<br><br>
So here is the setup procedure:<br><ol><li>Install <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span></a> for your desired
development platform.&nbsp; (If you are developing/debugging
your AGC/AEA code in Linux, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> may be in your Linux
distribution's packaging system.)</li><li>Installation of AGC/AEA syntax-highlighting enhancement for
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>:</li><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><li>Copy the contents of <span style=
"font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>/Resources/SyntaxHighlight/CodeBlocks/lexers/
to the lexers/ folder of your <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span> installation:</li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>For a default Linux installation:&nbsp;
"/usr/share/codeblocks/lexers".</li><li>For a default Win32 installation:&nbsp; TBD.</li><li>For a default Mac OS X installation:&nbsp; TBD.</li></ol><li>Run <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>.<br></li><li>Verify installation of syntax-highlighting by selecting
Settings/Editor/Syntax-highlighting from the main menu.&nbsp;
If "AGC Assembly" and "AEA assembly" are among the choices in
the language-selection drop-down list, then the
syntax-highlighting enhancement has been installed
properly.</li></ol><li>Configuration of AGC toolchain:</li><ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><li>From the main menu, select
Settings/Compiler-and-debugger.</li><li>In the Global-compiler-settings section:</li><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Make sure that "GNU gcc Compiler" is the "Selected
compiler".</li><li>Click the "Copy" button and in the "Add new compiler"
pop-up window that appears, choose the name "AGC yaYUL
Assembler".</li><li>In the "Compiler Flags" tab, make sure that no flags
are enabled.</li><li>In the "Toolchain executables" tab (which you may need
to scroll rightward to find):</li><ul><li value=9><span style=
"text-decoration: underline;">For Mac OS X only</span>,
in the "Additional Paths" tab next to the "Program Files"
tab, add the path "<span style=
"font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>/MacOS".&nbsp;
(All of the other settings below are in the "Program
Files" tab and apply to all platforms unless stated
otherwise.)<br></li><li>For the "Compiler's installation directory" choose
<span style="font-style: italic;">InstallDir</span>.</li><li>For the "C compiler", "C++ compiler", "Linker for
dynamic libs", and "Linker for static libs" choose either
"yaYUL" or "yaYUL.exe" depending on your platform.</li><li>For the "Debugger", set "yaAGC" or "yaAGC.exe"
depending on your platform.</li><li>Leave the "Resource compiler" setting blank.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For
Win32</span>, you may will probably need to change the
"Make program" setting whatever 'make' you're actually
using, and to add the path in which it is located to the
"Additional Paths" tab.<br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For FreeBSD
only</span>, if you are using GNU make rather than the
default 'make' provided by the operating system, change
the "Make program" setting to "gmake".<br></li></ul></ol></ol><li>Configuration of AEA toolchain:&nbsp; <span style=
"font-style: italic;">Not implemented yet</span>.</li></ol><h4><a name="Project-creation_procedure_in" id=

software<br></h2><h3><a name=BuildLinux id="BuildLinux"></a>Linux</h3><p>I would recommend reading <a href=
"https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/blob/master/README.md#linux-1">
the instructions at the GitHub repository</a>, which (of course)
cover building from a Git clone of the code base.&nbsp; However,
the following are some older (though extremely-similar)
instructions related specifically to building from the
development snapshot tarballs.<br></p><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span>&nbsp; You will need
the normal <span style="font-weight: bold;">gcc</span> C/C++
compiler toolchain, as well as developer packages ("dev" or
"devel") for <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> and <a href=
"http://www.libsdl.org/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SDL</span></a>.&nbsp; I have been using the
2.8.<i>x</i> branch of wxWidgets, as opposed (say) to the
3.<i>x</i> branch, and I believe you probably need to do that as
well; fortunately, both can be installed on the computer at the
same time. These are all available in the package repositories of
the common current Linux distributions, though figuring out what
the package names are can be an adventure.&nbsp; Or, you can
install them from source if you swing that way.<br><br>
From the command line, unpack the development-snapshot tarball as
follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">tar
--bzip2 -xf yaAGC-dev-</span><span style=
"font-style: italic; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">YYYYMMDD</span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span><br></div><br>
After unpacking there will be a new directory called
"yaAGC".&nbsp;&nbsp; To build the programs,<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">cd
yaAGC</span><br style=
"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do
not</span> "configure".</span><br style=
"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><span style=
"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">make</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">#
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do
not</span> "make install".</span><span style=
"font-family: monospace;"><br style=
"font-family: monospace;"></span><br></div>(Note that while there is a 'configure' script provided, it
is presently used only for setting up builds of a couple of
now-obsoleted programs.&nbsp; Therefore, it does not matter
whether you run it or not, nor whether it succeeds or fails.)<br><br>
You'll find that this has created a directory
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/, which is same as the
installation directory provided by the binary installer program,
<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>.&nbsp; To match
the default setup of the installer program, you would<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">mv
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC ~/VirtualAGC</span><br></div><br>
(assuming you don't already have a directory ~/VirtualAGC/) and
make a desktop icon called "Virtual AGC" that links to
~/VirtualAGC/bin/VirtualAGC.&nbsp; The image normally used for
the desktop icon is found at&nbsp;
~/VirtualAGC/bin/ApolloPatch2.png.&nbsp; At this point you would
have something equivalent to what the binary installer would have
provided, except that you would have no uninstaller program.<br><br>

work,&nbsp;<a href=

the <a href="download.html#Prerequisites">prerequisites</a>, the
<a href="faq.html#Troubleshooting">trouble-shooting tips</a>, and
the <a href=
"download.html#Some_platform-specific_odditities">list of
quirks</a> for this platform.<br><h3><a name=BuildRPI id="BuildRPI"></a>Raspberry Pi
(Raspbian)</h3>This really isn't any different from building it
on <a href="#BuildLinux">any other Linux system</a>, but I'll go
through the steps for you anyway, which should work even on a
completely new Raspbian install.&nbsp; Laszlo Morocz provided the
original instructions, but I have tweaked them somewhat:<br><ul><li>Tested with the 2016-05-27 version of
Raspbian-Jessie.<br></li><li>The build goes a lot faster if you do it on (say) a
physical hard disk on the USB port, rather than on the standard
SD card.</li></ul><p>You can then do the following, from a command line:<br></p><blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install wx2.8-headers libwxgtk2.8-0
libwxgtk2.8-dev libsdl-dev libncurses5-dev liballegro4-dev
git<br>
git clone https://www.github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc<br>
cd virtualagc<br>
make<br></p></blockquote>The end result of this rather lengthy process is the
directory (within the virtualagc/ directory containing the
complete source tree)&nbsp; called VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/,
which in fact contains everything you need to run the program,
which you can do either in-place, or after copying it to some
other location.&nbsp; To actually run the program (say, in
place), you do this:<br><blockquote>
cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources<br>
../bin/VirtualAGC<br></blockquote>Or, of course, you could create a desktop icon that
does basically this same thing.<br><br>
Laszlo mentions the additional (disquieting) fact that the CPU
utilization rather high, and indeed if you ran every available
option on an early-model Pi, you could find yourself using close
to 100% of the CPU.&nbsp; For the default configuration of
VirtualAGC (Lunar Module AGC with DSKY and Telemetry but without
abort system or IMU), I find the following:<br><ul><li>Pi B+:&nbsp; 80% CPU utilization.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Pi 3: 40% CPU utilization.<br></li></ul><p>If that's too much for you, there are some things you may be
able to do to make it more efficient.&nbsp; First, note that the
VirtualAGC program — which isn't a component of the simulation,
but merely a convenient graphical interface so that you don't
have to memorize command-line options for the actual components —
takes 25-30% of the CPU (for either of the two Pi models
mentioned above) by itself.&nbsp; Tou don't really need to run it
if you don't want to.&nbsp; So:<br></p><ul><li>If you run the simulation just once from VirtualAGC, and
exit the simulation immediately after starting it, you'll find
that it has automatically created a script called "simulate"
which can be used to start that exact configuration of the
simulation without running VirtualAGC itself.&nbsp; As a
result, you get CPU utilizations closer to 50% or 10%,
respectively, on the two Pi models mentioned above.&nbsp; To
just run that script, you do this:</li></ul><blockquote><p>cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources<br>
./simulate<br></p></blockquote><ul><li>If you're more-adventurous, and more programming-savvy,
there may be a way to get various programs, but specifically
yaAGC and yaAGS, to use less CPU cycles, at the cost of less
accuracy time-wise.&nbsp; At various places in the program
suite, individual programs are put to sleep using the
nanosleep() function, specifically to avoid using CPU
cycles.&nbsp; So if you search for "nanosleep", you'll often
find nanosleeps with of req.tv_nsec=10000000 nanoseconds, or 10
milliseconds.&nbsp; Selectively changing some of those to (say)
100 milliseconds (100000000) or even 250 milliseconds
(250000000) might reduce the CPU utilization of those
particular programs.&nbsp; If you do try it and it works better
for you, let me know!</li></ul><h3><a name=FreeBSD id="FreeBSD"></a>FreeBSD</h3>Development
snapshots 20090405 through 20090421 could be built natively in
PC-BSD 7.02 (based on FreeBSD 7.1), and snapshots 20090502 and
after can be build natively on PC-BSD 7.1 (based on FreeBSD
7.2).&nbsp; Other versions of FreeBSD may work, but I have no
great confidence because my knowledge of FreeBSD is nil.<br><br>
As mentioned above, I would <span style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span> recommend
installing the Linux binary version of Virtual AGC.&nbsp; You may
be able to run the installer, but if your experience is like mine
you won't like what happens after that.&nbsp; Thus you should
build from source instead, according to the instructions in this
section.<br><br>
Here's the way <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> made it
work, in PC-BSD 7.1 with its software-developer package group
intalled:<br><ul><li>I installed <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> 2.8.9 from source
into /usr/local.&nbsp; You have to do something beyond my
understanding to get the system to find libwx*.so* at
runtime.&nbsp; I managed to monkey it into working, but I'm not
sure what I did, and you FreeBSD users are unlikely to care
about my wrong methods anyhow.&nbsp; Please let me know the
answer if you find one.<br></li><li>I installed <a href=
"http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU
<span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span></a> 6.0 from
source into /usr/local.&nbsp; (As a BSD kind of person, you may
be tempted to install the BSD-licensed <a href=
"http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">editline</a> library
instead, but it is not fully feature-compatible and cannot be
used.)</li><li>I found that <span style="font-weight: bold;">libSDL</span>
was already installed.</li><li>I installed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>
("pkg_add -r tk-wrapper").<br></li><li>I unpacked the Virtual AGC snapshot tarball ("<span style=

yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span></span><span style=
"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>").</li><li>I cd'd into the yaAGC/ directory and built ("gmake
FREEBSD=yes").&nbsp; <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Do</span> <span style=

and <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> "gmake
install".</li></ul>You'll find that this has created a directory
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/.&nbsp; I'd suggest you should
also<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">mv
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC ~/VirtualAGC</span><br></div><br>
(assuming you don't already have a directory ~/VirtualAGC/) and
make a desktop icon called "Virtual AGC" that links to
~/VirtualAGC/bin/VirtualAGC.&nbsp; The image normally used for
the desktop icon is found at&nbsp;
~/VirtualAGC/bin/ApolloPatch2.png.&nbsp; The end result of these
manipulations is something identical to what the Linux binary
installer would have produced except that it will actually work
and that there won't be any uninstaller program.<br><br>

only tried OpenSolaris 0811.&nbsp; In order to get development
snapshot 20090503 (and hopefully beyond) to build, having no
knowledge of Solaris, I had to do quite a lot of ignorant
monkeying around.&nbsp; When that happens, of course, there may
be essential steps of the process that don't get recorded, or
extra steps that are accomplished but serve no purpose.&nbsp; I
expect that any Solaris users are likely clever enough about
their OS to figure these things out and let me know of
deficiencies in my description.&nbsp;<br><br>
There are so many problems on Solaris right now that I'd hesitate
to recommend using Virtual AGC in that environment.<br><br>
At any rate, here are the one-time setup steps I performed:<br><ul><li>I installed (or happily accepted the pre-installation, as
the case may be) the following packages, using the package
system:</li><ul><li>SUNWgnome-common-devel</li><li>SUNWGtk</li><li>SUNWxorg-headers</li><li>FSWxorg-headers</li><li>SUNWncurses</li><li>SUNWtcl</li><li>SUNWtk</li><li>SUNWlibsdl<br></li></ul><li>Installed <a href=

2.8.9 from source into /usr/local, configuring with "configure
--disable-shared".&nbsp; (While there is a package called
SUNWwxwidgets which can be installed from the package system,
in the version I tried the switches produced by `wx-config
--cxxflags` are incompatible with <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gcc</span>, so I eliminated it.&nbsp; Your
luck might be better.)&nbsp; The Virtual AGC makefiles are
simply going to take the first <span style=

present makefiles may be too simple for you if you have more

yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span></span><span style=
"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">.tar.bz2</span>").</li><li>Then 'cd' into the yaAGC/ directory and build ("make

and <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">do</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">not</span> "gmake

yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/.&nbsp; I'd suggest you should
also<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">mv
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC ~/VirtualAGC</span><br></div><br>
(assuming you don't already have a directory ~/VirtualAGC/) and
make a desktop icon called "Virtual AGC" that links to
~/VirtualAGC/bin/VirtualAGC.&nbsp; The image normally used for
the desktop icon is found at&nbsp;
~/VirtualAGC/bin/ApolloPatch2.png.&nbsp; The end result of these
manipulations is something identical to what a binary installer
would have produced (if one existed), except that there won't be
any uninstaller program.<br><br>
Sadly, none of the ACA simulation (joystick) programs work in
this environment, so you'll have no joystick controls.&nbsp; But
I suppose it's possible that this is just my test environment,
which is a virtual machine, so you might have better luck than
I.&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't forget to read the <a href=

that <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> I build
the Mac OS X version of the Virtual AGC binaries <a href=
"#Cross-Compiling">in Linux</a> rather than in Mac OS X.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, in development snapshot 20090415 and later, it's
possible to build the Mac OS X version of Virtual AGC natively
from Mac OS X 10.5.&nbsp; I've only tried it in 10.5.6 (Intel)
myself.&nbsp; Anything I say below about building in 10.4 is pure
speculation.&nbsp; Note also that since I don't use this
procedure myself, you can't expect that I try it out for every
development snapshot.&nbsp; Building the Mac version natively
according to the instructions below gives you something
functionally identical to the binary download package, except
that you won't have the alternate joystick handler (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>), so if the primary joystick
handler (<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) doesn't
work for your joystick model then you won't be able to use a
joystick.<br><br>
Note that most of the steps below are one-time setup, and that
the actual build after setup is complete is quite simple.<br><ol><li>Mac OS X 10.5 includes <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.4, which in theory is
too early a version.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it appears to work and
I won't quibble about it.&nbsp; Mac OS X 10.4 includes
<span style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.5, which is
definitely (I think) not going to work, so you'll want to
install <span style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.9
or later; probably you'll need to do this <a href=
"http://www.wxwidgets.org">from source</a>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>, which is
needed for the joystick handler program (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>) is also pre-installed, but
I haven't figured out how to use it.&nbsp; (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Hint</span>: if from a command line a
program called "sdl-config" is in your PATH, you <span style=
"font-style: italic;">don't</span> need to install <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>; if it isn't, then you
do.)&nbsp; So what I did was to <a href=
"http://www.libsdl.org">download the source tarball</a>, unpack
it, configure it ("./configure"), build it ("make"), and
install it ("sudo make install").&nbsp; This puts <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SDL</span> into /usr/local, where it won't
conflict with your already-installed version.</li><li>From a command-line, cd to some (preferably empty) working
directory and unpack the Virtual AGC development-snapshot
tarball ("tar -xjf yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span>.tar.bz2"), thus creating
a sub-folder called yaAGC/ containing the Virtual AGC source
tree.</li><li>Browse to the web to download the <a style=
"font-weight: bold;" href=
"http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a>
application's dmg file.</li><li>Double-click the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> dmg file, and once it's
open find the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> application (<img style=
"width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="Terminator.png" align=
"middle" height="41" width="42">).</li><li>Drag the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span>
application from the open dmg file to the working directory in
which you created yaAGC/ in step 3 above.<br></li><li>From a command line in that working directory, make a
tarball from Terminator.app ("tar -cjvf Terminator.app.tar.bz2
Terminator.app").&nbsp; Once you have the tarball, you can
eliminate the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Terminator</span> app itself, along with
its dmg file.<br></li><li>From the working directory (not from within the yaAGC/
directory) you would build Virtual AGC using the command "make
-C yaAGC MACOSX=yes".&nbsp; In the&nbsp; folder
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/, you should now find the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> application (<img style=
"width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" src="ApolloPatch3.png"
align="middle" height="40" width="40">).<br></li><li>If you like, drag the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> application from
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/ to the desktop.&nbsp; (It's better to
drag rather than to use a 'cp' command, to make sure that Mac
OS X admits that the folder is actually an
application.)<br></li><li>You're ready to go!</li></ol>And don't forget to read the <a href=

<h3><a name=BuildOther id="BuildOther"></a>Windows<br></h3>Note
that <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> I build
the Windows version of the Virtual AGC binaries <a href=
"download.html#Cross-Compiling">in Linux</a> rather than in
Windows.&nbsp; However, Onno Hommes (thanks, Onno!) has worked
out the build procedures, so for versions of May 2009 and later,
you should be able to do a native build on Windows.&nbsp; I have
tried it only on Windows XP and Windows 7.&nbsp; Since I have no
interest in it myself, this capability is not tested for every
development snapshot.&nbsp; First-time setup of the Windows box
is somewhat time-consuming, but the build is pretty easy after
that.&nbsp; I have information only on using open-source tools
for this, and if you wish to use tools like Microsoft Visual C++
you'll have to work out the details for yourself.&nbsp; (If you
do, expect it to be easy to build the AGC and AGS CPU simulation
programs and more difficult to build the various GUI interfaces
such as the DSKY and DEDA.)<br><br>
The trick is to install a Linux-like environment in which to
build the Virtual AGC software; but the Virtual AGC software
itself does not then need the Linux-like environment to
run.&nbsp; Here are the steps for first-time setup.&nbsp; I fear
that a certain amount of knowledge of UNIX-like systems is
needed, so if you are a pure Windows person you may find that the
following steps are more trouble to figure out than they are
worth to you.<br><ol><li>Install the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a>
compiler, using the downloadable setup.exe file.&nbsp; Use the
default choices for installation directory, etc.&nbsp; Among
the options you should choose (if given the choice) are
installation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">g++</span>
compiler and of <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">make</span>.</li><li>Install the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">Msys</a>
(Linux-like command shell) environment using the downloadable
setup.exe file.<br></li><li>Run <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span>, to bring
up a command shell.&nbsp; If you are unlucky enough to have a
Windows user name containing spaces, you will encounter
difficulties.&nbsp; For example, my home directory in
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> is "/home/Ron
Burkey", and this messes up some of the build steps that need
to be performed.&nbsp; My solution to this was to create a
directory called "/home/rburkey" and to 'cd' to that directory
whenever starting up Msys.&nbsp; It would also be wise to
change the value of the HOME environment variable to reflect
this change.&nbsp; When I refer below to your "home directory",
I mean whatever your equivalent of "/home/rburkey" is.<br></li><li>Install the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL
library</a>.&nbsp; You should find that there is a download
file specifically labeled as a Win32 development package for
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MinGW</span>.&nbsp; Within
your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> home
directory, unpack the download file, 'cd' into the directory it
creates, and run the command "make install-sdl
prefix=/usr/local".&nbsp; The /usr directory withing
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> will probably
correspond to something like c:\msys\1.0\ in your Windows
filesystem. &nbsp; <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; <span style=
"font-style: italic;">All</span> software needed to build
Virtual AGC will be installed under /usr/local, so eventually
it will be populated with sub-directories such as
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib, and so
on.&nbsp; The Virtual AGC makefiles are hard-coded to assume
these installation locations.&nbsp; Note, however, that the
Virtual AGC binaries you are going to create are <span style=
"font-style: italic;">not</span> installed under
/usr/local.</li><li>Obtain a source tarball of <a href=
"http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.&nbsp; At present,
Virtual AGC binary packages are always built with <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span> 2.8.9, so 2.8.9 is a safe
choice though it is not the only choice which works.&nbsp;
Unpack the tarball in your home directory, 'cd' into the
directory this creates, and then do "./configure", "make", and
"make install".&nbsp; The "configure" step will accept various
command-line options that select unicode vs. ansi, static
linking vs. dynamic linking, etc., but the default options seem
to work fine.</li><li>Install <a href=
"http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">POSIX Threads for
Windows</a> ("pthreads").&nbsp; There may be a number of
methods that work, but here is what I did:&nbsp; Unpack the
source tarball, 'cd' into the directory it creates, then run
the command "make clean GC-inlined".&nbsp; This creates various
files that you should copy into /usr/local as follows:&nbsp;
copy *.dll into /usr/local/bin; copy *.h into
/usr/local/include; copy the single libpthread*.a file created
into /usr/local/lib and rename it libpthread.a.</li><li>Install <a href=
"http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/readline.htm">GNU
readline for Windows</a>.&nbsp; You should find zipfiles of
both "binaries" and "developer files" are available for
download.&nbsp; They should both be downloaded and unpacked
into /usr/local.&nbsp; (I.e., each zipfile contains directories
like bin/, include/, lib/, and so on, and we want these to be
merged into /usr/local/bin/, usr/local/include/, etc.)</li><li>Install a regular-expression library.&nbsp; The <a href=
"http://www.mingw.org">MinGW project</a> has a "contributed"
regex library ("libgnurx") that you can use.&nbsp; Download
both the "bin" and "dev" tarballs and unpack them into
/usr/local.<br></li></ol>If all of this was done correctly, you should now be able to
build Virtual AGC, as follows:<br><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Unpack the development tarball in your home directory: "tar
-xjvf yaAGC-dev-<span style=
"font-style: italic;">YYYYMMDD</span>.tar.bz2".</li><li>Build it: "make -C yaAGC WIN32=yes".</li><li>On Windows 7&nbsp; (but not on XP) I found it necessary
additionally to copy c:\MinGW\bin\mingwm10.dll to
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources/.&nbsp; Whether
this is a difference between Windows 7 and XP, or whether it's
some ghastly improvement to MinGW since the time I installed it
last on XP, I can't say at the present time (and am not too
motivated to figure out).<br></li></ol>This will create a directory
yaAGC/VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/ which is the "installation
directory".&nbsp; When you download and run the Virtual AGC Win32
setup.exe file, this is the directory you get, except that the
setup program copies "lVirtualAGC/" to "c:\Program Files\" and
renames it "Virtual AGC".&nbsp; In fact, this directory is
relocatable, and you can move it wherever you like; nor does it
need to remain within the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Msys</span> environment.&nbsp; Whether you
leave this directory in place, or whether you move it to Program
Files, you really need to create a desktop icon in order to run
the program.&nbsp; The desktop icon should point to
lVirtualAGC\bin\VirtualAGC.exe as the executable, and should use
a "starting directory" of lVirtualAGC\Resources\.&nbsp; The
graphic normally used for the desktop icon is ApolloPatch2.jpg in
the lVirtualAGC\Resources directory.<br><br>

snapshot 20090802 and later, it's possible to build <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>—not the entire Virtual AGC
suite, just <b>yaAGC</b>—from (I guess) a Mac, if you've
downloaded an iPhone development kit.&nbsp; From the "I guess" in
the preceding sentence, you'll probably be able to deduce that
I'm just parrotting someone else's words and don't really know
what I'm talking about ... and you'd be right.&nbsp; The
instructions and mods necessary to do it came from Alberto Galdo
(thanks, Alberto!).&nbsp; If you try it and it doesn't work,
blame me for not implementing Alberto's instructions
properly.&nbsp; We'll zero in on it eventually.<br><br>
To build, simply 'cd' into the yaAGC/yaAGC/ folder and do
this:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
make IPHONE=yes<br></div><br>
As for how useful <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
by itself is, it's obviously only marginally useful until such
time as there's a DSKY.&nbsp; You should be able to do
command-line debugging, however, so you could in theory run and
debug AGC code.<br><br><h3><a name="Cross-Compiling" id=
"Cross-Compiling"></a>Cross-Compiling</h3>On the
very-low-probability chance that somebody actually wants to know
how to build the Windows and Mac versions on a Linux box, it's
very simple to do.&nbsp; It is, however, very wasteful of
calendar time (if not personal time), computer resources, and
bandwidth to set up the <span style=
"font-style: italic;">first</span> time, so I would not advise
you to do it on a lark:<br><ol><li>The oldest Linux on which I've made this work is Fedora
Core 5, so presumably any newer Linux would be okay.&nbsp; You
will need the normal <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">gcc</span> C/C++ compilier toolchain, as
well as developer packages ("dev" or "devel") for <a href=
"http://www.wxwidgets.org/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span></a> (2.8.9 or later),
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SDL</span></a>, and <a style=
"font-weight: bold;" href=
"http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro</a>.&nbsp; These are
all available in the package repositories of the recent common
Linux distributions, though figuring out what the package names
are can be an adventure.&nbsp; Or, you can install them from
source .<br></li><li>Download the installation tarball for the Windows/Mac
cross-compiling environment called <a style=
"font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.sandroid.org/imcross">I'm
Cross!</a>&nbsp; Please use version 20090426 or later.<br></li><li>In an empty directory (which for the sake of argument I'll
call ~/Projects), unpack the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross</span> tarball.&nbsp; This will
give you a directory called ~/Projects/IMCROSS/.</li><li>Within ~/Projects/IMCROSS/ create a text file called
Makefile.override-settings containing the following line:&nbsp;
"NO_SDL=".<br></li><li>Install <span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span>
using the instructions on the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> website, noting in
particular that you may have to install some additional
software to insure that the Mac OS X tools and libraries are
installed.&nbsp; However, do not customize the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> installation, since
Virtual AGC is designed to accept the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> defaults.&nbsp; This is
the part that takes a long time, and a lot of bandwidth and
disk space.&nbsp; The good news is that you can walk away from
it and let it do its job unattended.<br></li><li>Unpack the Virtual AGC development snapshot
(yaAGC-dev-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2) someplace.</li><li>Browse to the web to download the <a style=
"font-weight: bold;" href=
"http://software.jessies.org/terminator/">Terminator</a> dmg
file.&nbsp; In theory you may be able to 'mount' this in Linux,
but I simply opened it in Mac OS X.&nbsp; Inside, you'll find
an application called "Terminator", which (considering the way
Mac OS X works) is actually a folder called
"Terminator.app".&nbsp; Make a tarball from this ("tar -cjvf
Terminator.app.tar.bz2 Terminator.app"), and copy
Terminator.app.bz2 to the parent directory on your Linux box
where you unpacked the Virtual AGC development snapshot.&nbsp;
(In other words, Terminator.app.tar.bz2 and yaAGC/ should be in
the same directory.)<br></li><li>Back on Linux again, 'cd' into the yaAGC/ directory created
by unpacking the tarball.</li><li>Do "make all-archs".</li><li>In the directory yaAGC/VirtualAGC/, you'll find the
binary-installation packages for Linux (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>), Windows
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-setup.exe</span>),
and Mac OS X (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC.app.tar.gz</span>).</li></ol>The Windows/Mac binary packages you get this way are
equivalent if not necessarily byte-for-byte identical to the ones
I distribute.&nbsp; However, the Linux binary package will be
very different, and do not be fooled into thinking that it is as
portable as the one I provide.&nbsp; Very likely, it would work
on only a very restricted range of Linux boxes.&nbsp; The reason
for this is that I've gone out of my way to create a very generic
Linux system (with static as opposed to shared libraries to the
extent possible) on which I build the distribution Linux
installer for Virtual AGC.&nbsp; If you want to know how to do
<span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>, <a href=
"http://www.sandroid.org/imcross#LinuxCrossProblems">the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'm Cross!</span> website

"Some_platform-specific_odditities"></a>Some platform-specific
oddities</h2>Here are some strange things I noted when testing
out the downloadable binary-installation packages on various
target platforms.&nbsp; I can't say whether these quirks would
continue to exist if Virtual AGC was built from source.&nbsp; Nor
do I claim to have done a 100% test of all Virtual AGC features
on each platform, since Virtual AGC is a pretty large and complex
set of programs; in particular, I do not claim to have tested
joystick operation with any thoroughness.&nbsp; But if you have
difficulties, you may or may not find some help for them
below.<br><ul><li>Very slow machines.</li><ul><li>You may find that the simulation uses &gt;100% of the
available CPU, particularly if the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>-based <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> component is being
used.&nbsp; I fear that the only workaround for this at
present is to turn off the interfaces of the simulation which
you don't need.</li><li>You may find that the simulation (and particularly
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>) aborts
at startup, possibly with a pop-up box indicating that there
is a failure to connect to <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; This problem is
caused by the time needed to start the various program
components.&nbsp; You can introduce extra delay before these
checks are performed by editing a pair of files in the
installation directory (by default, ~/VirtualAGC/Resources in
Linux, c:\Program Files\Virtual AGC\Resources in Windows, or
~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources in Mac OS
X).&nbsp; In the file SimStop, change "sleep 5" to "sleep
30".&nbsp; In the file VirtualAGC.tcl, change "after 5000" to
"after 30000".&nbsp; These change some 5-second delays to 30
seconds.</li></ul><li>Networking must be properly configured, even though Virtual
AGC does not by default communicate with other computers,
because Virtual AGC uses TCP ports which Virtual AGC uses to
interconnect the various bits and pieces of the
simulation.&nbsp; So if you don't have a network card or
wireless, it may be difficult to get Virtual AGC to work.&nbsp;
Specifically:<br></li><ul><li>If you have SE Linux (or I guess, the equivalent security
features in Windows/Mac OS X) enabled, it may block Virtual
AGC from using networking as being an untrusted
application.&nbsp; (I believe that most modern Linux
distributions, such as Fedora, enable SE Linux functionality
by default.)&nbsp; Personally, I have no need for SE Linux ,
so I always just completely disable it, and hence I can't
give you much additional insight into <span style=
"font-style: italic;">details</span> about reconfiguring it,
but I presume there's some way to identify the bits and
pieces of Virtual AGC (namely VirtualAGC, yaAGC, yaAGS,
yaDSKY2, yaDEDA2, yaTelemetry, and Tcl/Tk) as being trusted
applications.</li><li>If you have a personal firewall software enabled, it may
block the TCP ports which Virtual AGC uses.&nbsp; The ports
in question are (by default) 19697-19706, 19797-19806, and
19897-19906.&nbsp; I generally just disable personal
firewalls on my computers since I'm always behind a physical
firewall anyway, but usually there's some sort of a GUI
configuration program you can run to open holes in the
firewall for specific TCP ports.</li><li>By default, it is generally possible when making network
connection to refer to a computer either by the host name you
assign it when you install the operating system, or by the
default name "localhost".&nbsp; Virtual AGC uses the
latter.&nbsp; I am told that there are some conditions,
possibly having to do with the use of wireless (though the
problem has been reported to me as a problem with the Network
Manager on Fedora 11 Linux), in which the computer cannot be
accessed using the default name "localhost".&nbsp; Hence
Virtual AGC fails.&nbsp; In Linux, this can be gotten around
by adding the line "127.0.0.1 localhost" in the file
/etc/hosts.&nbsp; (If the line "127.0.0.1 <span style=
"font-style: italic;">something</span>" already exists, then
just add "localhost" to the end of it.)&nbsp; I presume that
you can diagnose both the problem and verify the fix by
trying "ping localhost" from a command line.&nbsp; Thanks to
Onno Hommes for pointing out this problem and the fix for
it.<br></li></ul><li>Linux, installed from binary package<br></li><ul><li>Fedora Core 1—the <span style=

I also have a report that the joystick configurator does not
work properly even when <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> is added, but it worked for
me.<br></li><li>Ubuntu 7.04, 32-bit—no odditites noted.</li><li>Ubuntu 8.04, 64-bit—no oddities noted.</li><li>Ubuntu 8.10, 32-bit—no oddities noted.</li><li>OpenSUSE 10.1, 32-bit—no oddities noted.</li><li>OpenSUSE 11.1, 32-bit—the KDE 4 desktop system refused to
admit that the installer program (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC-installer</span>) was an
executable program, so it was necessary to run the installer
from the command-line rather than by clicking on its desktop
icon.&nbsp; Moreover, the installer could not be run unless a
software package called "itcl" (which is present on the
OpenSUSE distribution disk) was installed.&nbsp; Fortunately,
the installer ran normally, and the KDE 4 desktop did
recognize <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
itself as an executable program after installation.&nbsp;
Positioning of text in some of the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> screens was somewhat
unusual, but not unusable.<br></li></ul><li>Windows, installed from binary package</li><ul><li>Windows 95, 98—<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> is unusable on Windows
95 or 98, even if it could be built from source there.&nbsp;
The reason is that none of the batch files created by Virtual
AGC are compatible with the command shell in Windows 95 or
98.&nbsp; It is possible that individual programs like
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span> may be usable there if
controlled from the command line rather than from the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI, but I
no longer have any means of verifying or denying this.</li><li>Windows 2000—unknown.</li><li>Windows XP—</li><ul><li>Windows will sometimes (but not always) pop up a
warning window asking whether it should "block" or
"unblock" <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>—presumably
because they are servers and therefore might do Very Bad
Things to your computer.&nbsp; I think the only thing the
"block" does is to prevent network access via a firewall,
and since usually all of your Virtual AGC servers and
clients are running on the same computer anyway, it doesn't
really matter whether you block or unblock: it seems to
work fine either way.<br></li><li>Some of the programs (such as the telemetry monitor)
may not always be closable from the
operating-system-supplied controls around the border of the
windows.&nbsp; However, they will close down normally if
(for example) you close the DSKY.</li><li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
program is unusable, because if its window loses focus it
is unable to access the joystick thereafter.</li><li>Windows always displays a message when <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> shuts down that it has
experienced "a problem" and asks whether or not you want
Microsoft informed.&nbsp; Well, I don't know why the
message appears, but <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> seems to work well
enough for our purposes.&nbsp; Neverthless, if the message
annoys you, you should use the default <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> anyway (assuming that it
works for you).<br></li><li>The main GUI programs (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA2</span>, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span>) don't seem to
produce any console output, so if you run them from a
command line—say, "yaDSKY2 --help"—you won't see any
messages.&nbsp; I believe that you may still be able to see
something if you pipe the output into a file—as, for
example, "yaDSKY2 --help &gt;temp.txt".</li><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
program displays no prompt, but otherwise seems to work
properly.</li><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
program sometimes displays garbage characters upon pressing
keys at startup.&nbsp; However, the commands being entered
by the keystrokes are interpreted correctly and after
executing a command or two it settles down and works
properly.<br></li><li>If using the command-line debug modes for <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> or <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, their terminal windows
will not close automatically when the other windows close,
nor will <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> be
halted.&nbsp; You'll have to close those windows
manually.<br></li></ul><li><a name=VistaQuirks id="VistaQuirks"></a>Windows Vista
and Windows 7—I do not have dedicated Windows Vista or
Windows 7 machines on which to perform testing.&nbsp;
However, because of the continued complaints I've received
about Vista, I have been able to do some limited testing with
Windows Vista Home Basic and with the Windows 7 Release
Candidate.&nbsp; Additionally, I have received some notes on
this subject from users of my <a href=
"http://www.sandroid.org/GutenMark">Project Gutenberg
Prettifier, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">GutenMark</span></a>, whose programs are
constructed using techniques similar to Virtual AGC.&nbsp; So
here are some things that may or may not be useful to
note:</li><ul><li>&nbsp;Jim Adcock (thanks, Jim!) sent word that it was
necessary to change the properties of all of&nbsp; the .exe
files in the bin/ sub-directory of the installation
directory (by default, "c:\Program files\VirtualAGC\bin')
to "Run as Administrator".&nbsp; I personally did not find
it necessary to do this for Virtual AGC.<br></li><li>A user identified only as "Wendl" (thanks, Wendl!) sent
word that it was additionally necessary to change the
properties of the .exe files to select compatibility with
XP Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I personally did not find it
necessary to do this for Virtual AGC.</li><li>Brendan O'Rourke (thanks Brendan!) has pointed out that
an error "Cannot create file simulation.bat" occurs when
trying to run the simulation.&nbsp; I have found that this
may&nbsp; not happen at first, but may begin happening
after Windows is shut down and then restarted again
later.&nbsp; The problem appears to be that Windows is not
consistent in the permissions you are given, so you are
fooled into thinking that Virtual AGC works, but only later
find that you don't have the proper permissions to run
it.&nbsp; Here is the fix:</li><ol><li><img style="width: 751px; height: 281px;" alt="" src=

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For example,
in trying to select a source-code file to assemble, I've
found that the file dialog opens at Resources\scenarios,
whereas it is supposed to open at
Resources\source.</span></li><li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The
command-line debug modes for</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">yaAGC</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and</span><span style=
"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">yaAGS</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">may sometimes
display garbage at first when you type at the keyboard,
though eventually starts properly displaying
keystrokes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, unlike other versions of
Windows in which this is merely an annoyance, in Vista/Win
7 it may instead cause the simulation to abort.&nbsp; I've
had pretty good luck working around this by hitting a few
carriage returns before typing in the first actual
debugging command.</span><br></li></ul></ul></ul><ul><li>Windows, natively built from source</li><ul><li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
joystick-handler program cannot display the joystick
readings, and therefore is hard to configure using the
"Handler" functionality.&nbsp; (Also, after trying to
configure it with "Handler", it remains running rather then
being closed down, and you have to manually terminate it by
using ctrl-alt-delete to bring up a process list.)&nbsp; In
spite of these quirks, it does actually work properly when
running a simulation.</li><li>AGC/AGS program listings may or may not align at the
proper tab-stop positions when viewed in a browser.<br></li></ul><li>Mac OS X, installed from binary package<br></li><ul><li>All—Mac OS X insists on opening all of the windows (DSKY,
DEDA, telemetry monitor, etc.) exactly atop each other, so
that on each run you have to manally move the windows around
in order to see them.</li><li>10.2 and prior—the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> binary distribution is
unusable on these platforms.<br></li></ul><ul><li>10.3.9 and 10.4.11 (PowerPC)—</li><ul><li>The IMU (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span>) does not seem to
respond to the hand-controller (<span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>), even though both of
them appear to work individually.&nbsp; This may have
something to do with the fact that the iMac I'm running it
on is old and very slow.&nbsp; (The simulation takes
&gt;100% of the CPU time.)</li><li>The AGS/DEDA pair of programs seems to intermittently
freeze up and require rebooting.&nbsp; I suspect that this
is because on the old 400 MHz G3 I'm using the CPU loading
is at 300%, and there are some timing requirements on
AGS/DEDA communications that aren't being met.&nbsp; But
I'm not sure, and it could be a different bug.</li></ul><li>10.3.9 (PowerPC)—</li><ul><li>The file-save and file-open dialogs for core-dump saves
and opens, and for Digital Uplink, refuse to navigate to
the proper directory (by default,
~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources/scenarios/); it
may be advisable to copy or link this directory to the
Desktop or some other accessible location if you wish to
use these features.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Can't run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in --debug
mode from <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>.<br></li></ul><li>10.5.6 (Intel)—In spite of my best efforts, I've seen
instances in which <a href=
"yaTelemetry.html#LM_Simulator_by_Stephan_Hotto">the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> portion
of the simulation suite</a> does not shut down when the
remainder of the simulation shuts down, and needs to be
terminated manually from its menu.</li><li>Even on my fastest box (which is a Core Duo Mac Mini),
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LM-Simulator</span> runs at
fractional speed, and is therefore useless (whilst the
remainder of Virtual AGC proper is running fine at full
speed).&nbsp; I suspect an incompatibility in <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Tcl/Tk</span>.</li><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> program
displays no prompt, but otherwise seems to work
properly.</li><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">The "debug" mode
for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> program
sometimes displays garbage characters upon pressing keys at
startup.&nbsp; However, the commands being entered by the
keystrokes are interpreted correctly and after executing a
command or two it settles down and works properly.</li></ul><li>Mac OS X, built natively from source</li><ul><li>The "Retro" display mode of the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program may not
work.<br></li></ul><li>FreeBSD, natively built from source.</li><ul><li>For joystick handling, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> works, but <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> and <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> do not.</li><li>There is some unusual horizontal positioning in some text
which is supposed to be centered.</li><li>The crossed-out sub-items are observations of problems
which I no longer observe.<br></li><ul><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">When running
<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in
command-line debug mode, there is no command-line prompt,
except that one appears sometimes <span style=
"font-style: italic;">after</span> hitting the
carriage-return.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it seems to work
properly otherwise.</li><li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Source browsing
does not seem to work from <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, because the paths
to the html files (which exist!) aren't constructed
properly.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nor does
assembly of source code from</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: line-through;">VirtualAGC</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work,
presumably for the same reason (badly-constructed
paths).</span><br></li></ul><li>What success I had was with PC-BSD 7.1.&nbsp; I was
previously able to build on PC-BSD 7.02, but have not had a
working setup for a while to see if it still works in
7.02.</li></ul><li>Solaris.</li><ul><li>Only OpenSolaris 0811 has been tried.</li><li>There is some unusual horizontal positioning in some text
which is supposed to be centered.</li><li>No joystick-handler program is available.&nbsp;
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span> doesn't
build, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> build but
don't work ... at least for me.)</li><li>Redrawing of graphical objects seems intermittent.&nbsp;
For example, some digits on the DSKY might get updated, and
others might not.</li><li>The telemetry-display program never displays any
telemetry.</li><li>In command-line debug mode, <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> spontaneously abort and end
the simulation.</li><li>Sometimes there is a spurious i/o command; for example,
when running the "validation" program on the AGC, the it
often seems as if it starts out with the PRO key
pressed.<br></li><li>It appears to me that several of these phenomena may be
due to data being lost or otherwise corrupted in the socket
system; perhaps some of the socket uptions I'm using aren't
as portable as I imagined.</li><li>Assembly doesn't work from within the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> environment.&nbsp; I
suspect that the file-open dialogs in Solaris may cause the
current working directory to change in ways I haven't been
anticipating.</li></ul></ul><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><center><br><span style=
