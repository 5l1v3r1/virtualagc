    <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<br>
    </h2>
    <p>This page is a guide for Virtual AGC Project administrators,
      describing how to maintain the various online sites associated
      with the Virtual AGC Project.&nbsp; However, it is still necessary
      to have the appropriate administrative credentials to do so, and
      this page does not give you such credentials.&nbsp; In general,
      becoming an administrator requires manual action by existing
      administrators, and should only be done for trusted contributors
      having a long-term previous association with the project.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Local-Storage_Setup"></a>Local-Storage Setup</h2>
    <p>Because <a href="#Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO">the main Virtual AGC
        website</a> is stored on a Linux filesystem at ibiblio.org, with
      Linux filenames and permission structures, and because the helper
      scripts I provide here are BASH scripts, it would seem prudent
      only to maintain the main website using a Linux computer or
      virtual machine as well.&nbsp; Note that if the advice given on
      this page is followed completely, approximately 700GB (not a
      typo!) is currently required, with about 2TB for future
      expansion.&nbsp; See the section on <a
        href="#Internet_Archive_Backup">Internet Archive backup</a>.&nbsp;
      A minimal requirement (no Internet Archive backup) is closer to
      50GB plus room for expansion.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In order to maintain the main website conveniently, certain data
      needs to be maintained in local storage.&nbsp; To understand this
      data, one needs to distinguish between <i>development files</i>
      for the website and <i>downloadable files</i> from the
      website.&nbsp; "Development files" are things like HTML and
      JPG/PNG image files, JavaScript, CSS, and so on, needed to render
      the web pages correctly in browsers.&nbsp; These are development
      files because they tend to change over time, as the website is
      written and rewritten.&nbsp; The files themselves are stored on
      the Virtual AGC Project's GitHub repository, in a special branch
      named "gh-pages".<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Downloadable files" tend to be files which are very large in
      size and which never change after they are acquired.&nbsp;
      Typically they are digitizations of Apollo-era documents, usually
      scans which have been converted into PDF format.&nbsp; Regardless,
      because they almost never change and because they are very large,
      they are not stored in the Virtual AGC Project's GitHub
      repository, which has allocation limits that would constrain
      storage of this kind of information.&nbsp; In terms of megabytes,
      the Virtual AGC website consists almost entirely of these
      downloadable files, with the development-type files merely being
      the icing on the cake.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Two local-storage folders are absolutely required for updates to
      the main website, and two more are "optional" but are required for
      certain specific types of data:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Required development-file directory:&nbsp; This would be a
        local clone of the "gh-pages" branch of the Virtual AGC GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; By default, it is the directory
        ~/git/virtualagc-web/.&nbsp; However, it can be any directory,
        by storing the name in an environment variable called "HTML".</li>
      <li>Required website-image directory:&nbsp; This would be an exact
        image of the desired structure of the main website, except that
        the development files could be out of date.&nbsp; (The scripts
        provided for updating the website copy the development files
        into this directory before performing any uploads.)&nbsp; By
        default, it is the directory
        ~/Desktop/sandroid.org/public_html/apollo/.&nbsp; However, it
        can be any directory, by storing the name in an environment
        variable called "DOCS".</li>
      <li>Optional source-tree directory:&nbsp; This would be a local
        clone of the "master" branch of the Virtual AGC GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; On my own computer it's ~/git/virtualagc/, but
        it can be any folder, and there's no need for an environment
        variable.&nbsp; This directory is necessary if the local
        administrator wishes to update colorized AGC/AGS software
        listings.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Optional schematics directory:&nbsp; This would be a local
        clone of the "schematics" branch of the Virtual AGC GitHub
        repository.&nbsp; On my own computer, it's
        ~/git/virtualagc-schematics, but it can be any folder, and
        there's no need for an environment variable.&nbsp; This
        directory is necessary if the local administrator wishes to
        update Apollo guidance-system drilldowns or the
        engineering-drawing search engine.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2><a name="GitHub_Repository"></a>GitHub Repository</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">The Virtual
        AGC Project GitHub repository is found at this link</a>.&nbsp;
      This site is used for storing and tracking software source code
      and other engineering files (such as electrical schematics)
      subject to development and change.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Most administrative activities should be pretty straightforward,
      and can generally be understood by consulting GitHub's own
      documentation.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some familiarity with the various branches of the repository is
      useful.&nbsp; The most-significant branches are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>master:&nbsp; All available Apollo-era software source code
        (especially the AGC, AGS, LVDC, and Gemini OBC flight
        computers), plus all assemblers and emulators for them.&nbsp;
        LVDC flight programs are not included at the present time
        because of potential concerns about "exporting" them under ITAR.</li>
      <li>gh-pages:&nbsp; Development files (HTML, JPG/PNG images, and
        similar materials) corresponding to the <a
          href="#Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO">main project website</a>.&nbsp;
        It does not include large, archival objects (such as digitized
        PDF of Apollo-era documents) that are intended only for download
        rather than for website development, because those materials are
        very large in comparison to the GitHub resources allocated to
        the project.&nbsp; <a
          href="https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/index.html">GitHub
          presents this material also in a form accessible to browsers</a>,
        which I call "the staging area" for the main website.&nbsp; At
        any given time, the contents of the staging area may or may not
        be identical to that of the main website, and links on the
        staging area to downloadable files (available only on the main
        website) may or may not work. <br>
      </li>
      <li>mechanical:&nbsp; 2D mechanical drawings and 3D models created
        for original Apollo-era mechanical drawings of things like the
        AGC, DSKY, and so on.</li>
      <li>scenarios:&nbsp; Setup data for NASSP/Orbiter of various
        Apollo mission scenarios.</li>
      <li>schematics:&nbsp; Electrical CAD files and simulation files
        created from AGC electrical schematics.</li>
      <li>wiki:&nbsp; Wiki files for the GitHub wiki associated with the
        project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other branches are all, or mostly, created for temporary purposes
      and don't necessarily have any permanent significance.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To obtain administrative privileges, it's necessary to have a
      GitHub account, and to have an existing project administrator
      assign administrative privileges to that account.<br>

    <h2><a name="Virtual_AGC_Project_on_the_Internet"></a>Virtual AGC
      Project Collection on the Internet Archive</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/virtualagcproject">The
        Virtual AGC Project collection at the Internet Archive is found
        at this link</a>.&nbsp; This site is used for archival storage
      of the highest-quality original scans available to us of
      Apollo-era documents.&nbsp; In almost all cases, this means that
      the scans were performed by the Virtual AGC Project, or at its
      request, without being available elsewhere online.&nbsp; For
      example, all original scans of AGC software assembly listings are
      stored here.&nbsp; Such scans are generally too large (in
      megabytes) for convenient day-to-day use.&nbsp; Thus, smaller,
      lower-quality versions are created for day-to-day use, and stored
      at <a href="#Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO">the main Virtual AGC
        Project website</a>.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it's desirable to
      retain the highest-quality scans as well, for purposes such as
      checking for possible errors in the lower-quality scans, for
      occasionally providing imagery to graphic artists (or just other
      people in general) on request, and so on, and that's what our
      Internet Archive collection is used for.&nbsp; If you have simply
      obtained a PDF of a document from someone and want to use it
      as-is, it would generally be posted directly to the main website,
      and there would be no purpose in uploading it to our Internet
      Archive collection.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A slight exception is that a large number of scans (100,000+) of
      Apollo engineering drawings are stored <i>only</i> in our
      Internet Archive collection, without being made available in a
      lower-resolution form on the main project website.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Administrative access to this Internet Archive collection allows
      you to:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upload new documents to the collection.&nbsp; An upload will
        usually, but not always, be a zipfile or tarball of scanned
        images representing the individual pages of an Apollo-era
        document.&nbsp; Occasionally the file might be a PDF of such a
        document.</li>
      <li>Change the metadata for the document (using an "Edit" tool on
        that document's web-page in the collection).</li>
      <li>Change the specific uploaded files comprising the document
        (also using the "Edit" tool).</li>
      <li>Perform other technical operations, such as removing the
        document from the Internet Archive's index (using the "Manage"
        tool).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While there are many variations to the number, format, and naming
      of files uploaded, I would recommend the following:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For any given document, upload it as a single zipfile or
        uncompressed tarball of JPG or PNG images.&nbsp; Use the
        highest-quality images available.&nbsp; PNG is preferable in
        terms of quality, but if JPG is <i>much</i> smaller without any
        detectable difference in quality, that's fine too.</li>
      <li>The page-ordering in which the Internet Archive displays the
        individual images is determined by the alphabetical order of the
        filenames.&nbsp; However, the alphabetical collation may not be
        what you expect, so it's best to name the PNG or JPG files
        according to some predictable pattern, such as:&nbsp; <i>basename</i>_0001.jpg,
        <i>basename</i>_0002.jpg, ..., with all the page numbers being
        padded with zeroes to have the same number of digits.&nbsp; This
        always results in page-numbering that's exactly what you expect.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The zipfile or tarball name <i>must</i> end literally with
        "_images.zip" or "_images.tar" (note the underline)!&nbsp; For
        example, "MyDocument_images.tar".&nbsp; If you leave out the
        "_images", then the Internet Archive will not attempt to display
        the individual pages online, and you'll have to correct the
        file's name and re-upload it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When uploading a document, you are asked to specify various
      metadata about it.&nbsp; As mentioned above, this metadata can be
      edited afterwards, but it's usually more convenient to get it
      right the first time.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to the
      following metadata fields:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>title:&nbsp; By default, this will be some trivial variant of
        the filename, and that's usually inadequate, so make it
        something decent instead.<br>
      </li>
      <li>creator:&nbsp; That's whoever wrote the original document
        (such as the author's name, or MIT Instrumentation Laboratory,
        or something of that nature); it's not <i>your</i> name.</li>
      <li>collection:&nbsp; That's literally "virtualagcproject"
        (without the quotes).</li>
      <li>description:&nbsp; Self-explanatory.</li>
      <li>subject keywords:&nbsp; These will vary, so you'll have to use
        your own judgement, but it's often some combination of "nasa",
        "apollo", "agc", "guidance", "computer", etc.</li>
      <li>language:&nbsp; Almost always English.</li>
      <li>license:&nbsp; Public Domain.&nbsp; The legal theory here is
        that material produced under contract for the U.S. Government is
        not subject to copyright, so it's always in the public
        domain.&nbsp; I.e., The People paid to create it, so The People
        own it; and if everyone owns it, then nobody does.&nbsp; This
        reasoning does <i>not</i> apply to commercial material which
        the government simply chose to purchase after the fact, so if
        there's reason to believe that that's the case, and that the
        material has a valid copyright, do <i>not</i> upload it.&nbsp;
        Similarly, do not upload material which you believe may be
        subject to ITAR restrictions.&nbsp; In terms of material marked
        as "classified" or "confidential", such material is
        automatically periodically downgraded in terms of it's
        classification level, and hence any Apollo-era documents should
        have been declassified decades ago, regardless of how they were
        originally marked; nevertheless, it is probably wiser <i>not</i>
        to upload such material.&nbsp; (I've not personally seen any
        such documents, except for a few instances in which they were
        specifically marked has having become unclassified.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can only be added as an admin by a direct action of the
      Internet Archive itself; i.e., a Virtual AGC administrator cannot
      make you a Virtual AGC administrator of their own volition,
      unassisted.&nbsp; A Virtual AGC administrator should submit a
      request at info@archive.org for the addition of a specific email
      address as an <i>extra</i> new administrator.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Internet_Archive_Backup"></a>Internet Archive Backup</h3>
    <p>One problem with the Virtual AGC Project's Internet Archive
      collection is that it provides no natural backup mechanism.&nbsp;
      With <a href="#GitHub_Repository">the GitHub site</a> and <a
        href="#Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO">the IBIBLIO site</a> described
      above and below, there are natural backup-like mechanisms:&nbsp;
      For the GitHub site, many people have local clones of the
      repository (<i>I</i> certainly do), so the information is
      inherently redundant, or at least mostly so.&nbsp; For the IBIBLIO
      site, administrators need to have complete local clones of the
      site in order to maintain it; so, again, there are natural backups
      that are complete or nearly complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the
      Internet Archive collection, however, there's no such natural
      backup mechanism, since after a file is uploaded there's no
      particular necessity to keep a local copy of it, and hence in the
      event of catastrophic failure of the Internet Archive, there's no
      reasonable expectation that any of the information uploaded to it
      is easily recoverable.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is therefore my own practice as an administrator to maintain a
      complete local copy of all Virtual AGC Project files from the
      Internet Archive collection, whether explicitly uploaded by me or
      whether internally generated by the Internet Archive.&nbsp; It's a
      tad wasteful of space, but it's the safest way to go about
      it.&nbsp; (I would note that a couple hundred boxes of aperture
      cards comprising the LM engineering drawings are scheduled for
      scanning, and while the uploads for them are on the order of 1GB
      each, the processing performed by the Internet Archive turns them
      into nearly 10GB downloads.&nbsp; One might, therefore, argue that
      a full download is unwarranted.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>This task is simplified by the fact that the Internet Archive
      itself provides <a
        href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/internetarchive/">a
        Python 3 script called 'internetarchive' or 'ia'</a>, which
      which can download Internet Archive files in a very flexible
      way.&nbsp; I store these downloads in a dedicated directory called
      virtualagcproject/, and the download command is simply:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">cd
        virtualagcproject<br>
        python3 /<i>PATH</i>/<i>TO</i>/ia download --search
        'collection:virtualagcproject'</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    This creates a subfolder of virtualagcproject/ for each document
    I've uploaded to our Virtual AGC Project collection, and stores each
    file (either downloaded or generated) in those subfolders.<br>
    <br>
    Though time-consuming, the downloading process is a very efficient
    one, in that it splits the download into blocks, and only downloads
    blocks which haven't previously been downloaded, or whose
    downloading has failed.&nbsp; This is helpful, since some files to
    be downloaded are 1GB+ in size; failure of a download only requires
    later download of blocks that have failed, rather than attempting to
    completely download the entire 1GB+.<br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, some care is necessary in interpreting the
    results of the download operation.&nbsp; Each document has a printed
    message indicating whether the result was a "success" or a
    "failure", but there are many hundreds of documents in the
    collection already, so it is easy not to notice if there were some
    failures.&nbsp; In other words, it may be necessary to re-run 'ia'
    twice or even more times, but it's necessary first to <i>notice</i>
    that a failure had occurred, and that's not always so easy. <br>
    <br>
    Note also that due to internal process changes (presumably,
    improvements) at the Internet Archive, files which were generated
    ("derived") by the Internet Archive may from time to time be
    re-derived even though new uploads have not occurred.&nbsp;
    Therefore, even when 'ia' has been completely successful, re-running
    it at some later time may still result in portions of some documents
    being re-downloaded.<br>
    <h2><a name="Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO"></a>Main Website at IBIBLIO</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo">The main Virtual AGC
        Project website is at this link</a>, but it is not administered
      at that link.&nbsp; Various means are used to administer the site,
      as follows:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Synchronizing the website contents with the contents of local
        storage: Assuming that <a href="#Local-Storage_Setup">the setup
          instructions for local storage</a> have been obeyed, I do this
        via <a href="ProjectMaintenance/UpdateApollo.sh">the BASH
          script UpdateApollo.sh</a>, of which there is more discussion
        below.</li>
      <li>Individual files can also be uploaded via 'scp', although
        proper setup of local storage there is little reason to do so,
        since bulky synchronization is easier and generally requires
        little more time.&nbsp; The primary use case, in my experience,
        would be if there are new documents to upload but a full bulk
        synchronization isn't immediately desired because the HTML files
        happen to be in a buggy state.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Certain precision changes to the website can be performed
        directly via 'ssh'.&nbsp; For example, file permissions can be
        changed, files can be deleted, etc.</li>
      <li>Some answers to administrative questions supposedly can be
        found on <a href="https://answers.ibiblio.org/index.html">the
          IBIBLIO Interactive Q&amp;A page</a>.&nbsp; I say
        "supposedly", because there are generally no answers to
        questions I have asked there.</li>
      <li>Help tickets can be filed at <a
          href="https://www.ibiblio.org/help/request/">the IBIBLIO Help
          Request page</a>.&nbsp; I wouldn't count on getting any help.</li>
    </ul>
    While you would not normally administer the site using 'ssh', it's
    helpful to explore how to do that, so that you understand the issues
    involved in using 'rsync' or 'scp'.&nbsp; When accessing the site
    via 'ssh', you find yourself at a Linux command line (at this
    writing, CentOS 6.10).&nbsp; Thus any tasks you need to perform at
    the command line are via normal Linux utilities.&nbsp; Your "home"
    directory after login is not where the project website's files are
    stored, but is basically an empty directory.&nbsp; The website
    files, rather, are stored in the directory /public/html/apollo/.<br>
    <br>
    The directory hierarchy of the website is rather complex and
    inconsistent, having evolved over time without much planning, but in
    general you can say the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Most HTML files and PNG/JPG images displayed from HTML pages
        are stored at the top level (/public/html/apollo/).</li>
      <li>Most downloadable documents are PDF files stored in the
        "Documents" directory (/public/html/apollo/Documents/).</li>
      <li>Colorized HTML assembly listings of AGC and AGS programs are
        stored in subdirectories of the "listings" directory
        (/public/html/apollo/listings/).</li>
      <li>The files for the online search engine for guidance-system
        engineering drawings are stored in the "TipueSearch" directory
        (/public/html/apollo/TipueSearch/).</li>
    </ul>
    There are many more, but these are the most-immediately relevant in
    terms of day-to-day maintenance of the website.<br>
    <br>
    For example, you could log in to the directory containing the
    website files and view the HTML files in that directory with the
    command-line commands:<br>
    <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">ssh <i>username</i>@login.ibiblio.org
        # Will prompt you for password.<br>
        cd /public/html/apollo<br>
        ls -l *.html</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>At this point you could also use 'chmod' to change file
      permissions, 'passwd' to change your password, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The same login credentials for 'ssh' are used with 'scp' and
      'rsync', and file you upload needs to be sent to
      /public/html/apollo/ or to subdirectories thereof.&nbsp; For
      example, to upload a single file called MyNewDocument.pdf from
      your current local directory to the Documents directory of the
      website:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">scp
        MyNewDocument.pdf</font> <font face="Courier New, Courier,
        monospace"><i>username</i>@login.ibiblio.org:/public/html/apollo/Documents</font></blockquote>
    <p>But in performing an operation like this, you may find that the
      uploaded document is not actually viewable from the website.&nbsp;
      That could happen, for example, if the file permissions are that
      it is readable by the owner or the owner and the group, but not by
      everybody.&nbsp; Since the browser won't be the file owner or
      belong to the owner's group, the browser cannot open the
      file.&nbsp; This is an example in which cleanup of by an 'ssh'
      login may be needed afterward.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Problems like that don't occur when you use bulk synchronization
      of the website to the image of the website on your local storage
      device(s).&nbsp; Such bulk synchronization is not normally done
      using 'rsync' directly, but ranter by using <a
        href="ProjectMaintenance/UpdateApollo.sh">the BASH script
        UpdateApollo.sh</a>, which automatically takes care of all such
      permission problems.&nbsp; <a href="#Local-Storage_Setup">Assuming
        that local storage is set up properly</a>, and that
      UpdateApollo.sh is in the PATH, the process is very simple; from
      any directory, simply do:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">UpdateApollo.sh</font><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    and give the appropriate password when prompted to do so.&nbsp; From
    the setup instructions, you'll recall that there are two local
    directories needed:&nbsp; $HTML, which is the complete is the local
    "gh-pages" branch of the Virtual AGC Projects' git source tree,
    containing stuff like the HTML and PNG/JPG files for the website;
    and $DOCS, which contains a <i>complete</i> local image of the
    website, but potentially with the HTML/JPG/PNG out-of-date.&nbsp;
    What the script does is to bring the $DOCS directory up to date (by
    copying in the contents of $HTML), perform various cleanup (such a
    fixing file permissions, adding .htaccess files), and then uploading
    the entire contents of $DOCS to the website via 'rsync'.<br>
    <br>
    Useful variants are:<br>
    <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">UpdateApollo.sh
        --dry-run&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Don't actually upload.</font><br>
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">UpdateApollo.sh
        --delete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Delete remote files that are
        absent from local storage.<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    <p>The latter variant (<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">--delete</font>)
      highlights a danger if there are multiple administrators whose
      local storage areas are <i>not</i> mutually synchronized.&nbsp;
      In that case, administrator A may have files that administrator B
      does not have; if <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">--delete</font>
      is used, then successive update operations by administrators A and
      B will keep removing and adding back the same file.&nbsp; Thus,
      multiple administrators must take care to insure that their
      actions are coordinated and their local storage areas are
      synchronized.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some other traps into which it is all to easy to fall:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The "listings" directory:&nbsp; Although colorized listings of
        AGC and AGS code are <i>created</i> by building the Virtual AGC
        Project software from source, those colorized HTML files simply
        remain in the build directories.&nbsp; In other words, they
        don't automatically get copied into the local image of the
        "listings" directory, and hence they don't automatically get
        updated on the website.&nbsp; It's necessary to explicitly copy
        the colorized HTML files from the project's build directories
        into the website's "listings" directory.&nbsp; I'll illustrate
        from my own computer's setup.&nbsp; There, the "master" branch
        of the Virtual AGC source tree is in the folder git/virtualagc/,
        while the "gh-pages" branch (i.e., the website's HTML/PNG/JPG)
        is in the git/virtualagc-web/ folder.&nbsp; If there's a <i>new</i>
        AGC software version available that has never appeared online
        before, coming (say) from the source directory
        git/virtualagc/Artichoke123/, then you'll need to explicitly
        create a target directory for it the first time it's going to be
        used:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">mkdir
          git/virtualagc-web/listings/Artichoke123<br>
          cd git/virtualagc/Artichoke123/Apollo32.png</font><br>
      </blockquote>
      In general, though, to simply update the "listings" directory
      using existing listings, you just do this:<br>
      <blockquote><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">cd
          git/virtualagc<br>
          find -name "*.agc.html" -exec cp {} ../virtualagc-web/listings
          \;</font><br>
      </blockquote>
      Having done this, an UpdateApollo.sh operation now sends
      up-to-date listings to the website.&nbsp; Of course, given that
      you are working in the local clone of the "gh-pages" branch of the
      git repository, you also need to use whatever git commands are
      appropriate for adding any new directories to the repository or
      for committing the newly-changed HTML files to the
      repository.&nbsp; Note that while the operation above has
      overwritten all of the listings/*.html files, the new files are
      almost always identical to the older ones they replaced, and hence
      committing them has no negative effect on bandwidth or storage
      allocated in the git repository.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The "TipueSearch" directory:&nbsp; This directory, as already
        mentioned, contains files for the online search engine for
        Apollo guidance-system engineering drawings.&nbsp; The directory
        is updated by running the script called "makeAllDrilldowns.sh"
        from the DrawingTree/ directory of the "schematics" branch of
        the Virtual AGC git repository.&nbsp; Running that script also
        updates all of the HTML files (<i>NNNNNNN-NNN</i>.html)
        associated with "drilldowns" of Apollo guidance-system
        assemblies.&nbsp; Thus, if changes had been made to the
        DrawingTree/ directory of the "schematics" branch, one might
        want to run "makeAllDrilldowns.sh" prior to UpdateApollo.sh.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The traps mentioned above are also problematic when there are
      multiple administrators for the website, since typically you'd
      expect only one of them, rather than <i>all</i> of them, to work
      on issues related to AGC assembly listings or to Apollo
      guidance-system assemblies.&nbsp; So not all of them would be
      keeping the associated files up-to-date in their local storage.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I have requested information from IBIBLIO, both by Interactive
      Q&amp;A and Help Ticket, as to how to add additional
      administrators for the Virtual AGC Project's collection at
      IBIBLIO.&nbsp; Alas, I do not expect to receive any help, though
      if I do then I'll update the description here.&nbsp; At present,
      there is a single administrative account, with <i>username</i>
      "apollo" and a single associated password.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Mailing_List_at_IBIBLIO"></a>Mailing List at IBIBLIO</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p><a href="https://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/admin/apollo">The
        mailing list is administered at this link</a>.&nbsp; As an
      admin, you can administer the obvious stuff, such as mailing-list
      settings, user lists, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Administrative access to <a href="#Main_Website_at_IBIBLIO">the
        main website</a> as described above does <i>not</i> give you
      administrative access to the associated mailing list.&nbsp; A
      mailing-list administrator can add other mailing-list
      administrators at the link above, and then inform the new
      administrators of the administrative password.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Warning:</b>&nbsp; All that happens when an administrator is
      added is that the new email address begins to receive email
      messages targeted at administrators; it does not allow the new
      administrator to actually log in and administer anything.&nbsp;
      Rather, the administrative interface has a <i>single</i> password
      (same password for all administrators!), and anybody with this
      password can log into the administrative interface and administer
      anything they like, regardless of whether they've been registered
      as an administrator or not.&nbsp; Thus, anybody with the password,
      administrator or not, could log in, change the password, and lock
      out all of the registered administrators.&nbsp; Or a registered
      administrator could do so, and lock out all of the other
      registered administrators.&nbsp; Indeed, I'd think this is very
      likely to happen with a new administrator, simply by accident, if
      they thought the password they were changing was their own
      personal password.&nbsp; If they subsequently forgot the password,
      thinking there was some easy recover method (there isn't),
      everybody is locked out!&nbsp; Poor, poor system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to list administrators, there is also the separate
      role of list moderators.&nbsp; Moderators have elevated
      permissions and can deal with various problems, but cannot change
      some of the configuration settings that administrators can.&nbsp;
      Most importantly, there is a separate moderator password from the
      administrator password, and therefore (where possible) it is
      preferable to give moderator status rather than administrative
      status.<br>
