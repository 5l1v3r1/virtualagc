TORQUER, MIDDLE GIMBAL	3	The final two digits of the assembly number are illegible in all available prints of this drawing, and none of the plausible candidate 20187xx alternative drawings are available for checking.  However, comparison of drawing 2018735 to the almost-identical drawing 2018757 verifies that the assembly number is 2018717.
