Launch



























    Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) was a computer that resided in the
    Instrument Unit (IU) that perched above the Saturn IVB that was the
    second stage in a Saturn IB rocket and the third stage in a Saturn V
    rocket.&nbsp; The LVDC was a completely separate computer system
    from the AGC, with a different architecture, different
    instruction-set, and different runtime software.&nbsp; The purpose
    of the LVDC was to precisely control the Saturn from shortly before
    liftoff until the point at which the Saturn was discarded by the
    CSM.&nbsp;<br>

            People generally think that the guidance computer (AGC) of
            the command module controlled the Saturn rocket, but it
            isn't true.&nbsp; During burns of the S-II and S-IVB rocket
            stages, it <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span>
            possible for the CSM's AGC to control the steering, as a
            backup to the LVDC.&nbsp; This was not possible during burns
            of the first stage (S-IB or&nbsp; S-IC).&nbsp; On the CSM's
            DSKY, the crew could see a display of various measurements
            taken by the rocket's sensors.&nbsp; I don't think the
            backup capability was ever used in a mission.&nbsp; Correct
            me if I'm wrong, please!&nbsp; However, the AGC's ability to
            directly control the Saturn IVB was used for other purposes
            during the mission.&nbsp; <a

    The LVDC has a less-visible role in people's eyes than the AGC, not
    only because it was used for only a very small portion of the
    individual missions, but also because it had no user interface as
    such.&nbsp; In other words, it was a black box that responded to
    inputs from sensors in the Saturn and to ground telemetry, but there
    was no panel into which astronauts could enter commands or get
    feedback from it.&nbsp; One might well call the LVDC "The Forgotten
    Computer", even more so that the computer of the <a
      href="yaAGS.html">LM's Abort Guidance System</a>.&nbsp;
    Nevertheless, the LVDC's importance is great, because you need to
    actually get the Command Module and Lunar Module into space and
    headed toward the moon if you expect any landings to occur!&nbsp; As
    I understand it, the folks that actually worked on the Saturn
    referred to the Instrument Unit as "The Brain", and that term might
    as well be applied to the LVDC, since it was the brain of The Brain.<br>

    The LVDC was developed by IBM Federal Systems Division, rather than
    by the MIT Instrumentation Lab that developed the AGC, so there was
    no overlap in development personnel between the LVDC and AGC
    systems.&nbsp; Furthermore, there was almost no overlap in
    engineering technique, other than that both groups of necessity were
    generally constrained by the technology available at the time.&nbsp;
    For example, both needed to use memory based on ferrite-core
    technology.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no interaction between the
    LVDC and AGC systems.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, there was some interaction between the development groups,
    in the sense that at some point in 1963 or before the idea arose
    that the LVDC might be used in place of the AGC in the CM and LM,
    and that this move might save some time and money.&nbsp; In fact,
    IBM produced a 300+ page report detailing the differences between
    the two systems with the apparent object of arguing this point, and
    the MIT Instrumentation Labs' antibodies flooded in to destroy the
    invader with critiques and reports negative of the IBM report.&nbsp;
    In the end, the Instrumentation Lab won this particular battle,
    relegating the LVDC to the relatively small share of public
    attention that it presently enjoys.<br>

    <h2><a name="Peripheral_Devices" id="Peripheral_Devices"></a>Peripheral



























      Devices</h2>
    As with any of the other computer systems we cover here at Virtual
    AGC, the LVDC does not stand alone and do its computing in a
    computing vacuum (so to speak).&nbsp; The subsystems involved are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA) interfaced the LVDC's
        digital signals to the analog world of the Instrument Unit's
        sensors.&nbsp; Actually, the LVDA is so closely coupled to the
        LVDC that it may make more sense to consider them a as forming a
        single unit, though packaged separately.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The ST-124-M Inertial Platform Assembly—catchy name!—was an
        inertial measuring unit that supplied the LVDC with information
        about the rocket's orientation and acceleration.&nbsp; It had 3
        integrating accelerometers that measured acceleration with
        respect to the stable (space-fixed as opposed to rocket-fixed)
        platform, as well as angular sensors to measure the orientation
        of the stable platform with respect to the rocket.&nbsp; Like
        the AGC IMU, it was a 3-gimbal system and therefore
        theoretically subject to "gimbal lock", but because the range of
        motion of the rocket during the burn phase, I suppose that
        avoidance of gimbal lock must have been somewhat easier than in
        the CM or LM.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The "Control Computer" or "Flight Control Computer" was an
        analog computer that translated attitude-correction commands,
        angular change, and vehicle lateral acceleration information
        into propulsion-system thruster nozzle and/or engine actuator
        positioning commands.&nbsp; As such, it is of little interest in
        simulation of the LVDC (which is our primary concern at Virtual
        AGC).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the naming of this device seems odd, note
        that it follows the general convention of the word "control"
        being defined to mean the execution of an action that has been
        decided upon elsewhere, and not the act of decision-making.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The Control-EDS Rate Gyros.</li>
      <li>The Control Accelerometers (Saturn IB only).</li>
      <li>The propulsion engine actuators.</li>
      <li>The auxiliary propulsion system.&nbsp; This was a set of 6
        nozzles mounted on the aft end of the S-IVB stage which were
        used to provide attitude control in coasting (non-burn)
        periods.&nbsp; I believe that it may also have provided roll
        control during the S-IVB turn during boost.&nbsp; (The engines
        of the S-IC and S-II stages could provide complete
        pitch/yaw/roll control, but the engine of the S-IVB state could
        only control pitch and yaw, and therefore needed to be
        supplemented to provide control of roll.)&nbsp; The auxiliary
        propulsion system was directly controlled by the Flight Control
        Computer, but the Flight Control Computer was commanded by the
        LVDC.</li>
      <li>Telemetry downlink.</li>
      <li>Command uplink.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    At the end of the preceding section was an illustration of a very
    simplified logical view of the interconnection of the LVDC to
    various peripherals.&nbsp; Here is a somewhat more complete
    illustration for the Saturn IB:<br>

            <p>The LVDC and the AGC did not actually have any direct
              interaction, so we may as well talk about how the AGC
              interacted with the Saturn before immersing ourselves in
              too much detail about the LVDC.<br>

              either of the graphics at the end of the preceding
              section, you'll see the four ways that the Instrumentation
              Unit (IU) in the Saturn IVB and the Spacecraft (i.e, the
              Command Module) — which are separated by a horizontal
              dotted line near the tops of the two graphics —
              interacted:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Abort Decision signal.</li>
              <li>The Status signal.</li>
              <li>The Mode Command signal.</li>
              <li>The Alternate Steering Commands signals.</li>
            </ol>
            The Saturn was always steered by the so-called Flight
            Control Computer (depicted in the picture at the right), an
            analog computer whose salient characteristic for our
            purposes is that it was <i>not</i> the LVDC.&nbsp; However,
            the flight-control computer did not operate on its own, and
            thus itself needed to be supervised.&nbsp; Normally, that
            supervision was performed, by default, by the LVDC,
            indirectly through the LVDA, the Launch Vehicle Data
            Adapter.<br>
            <p>However, it was also possible for the spacecraft to send
              the flight control computer a signal, the Mode Command,
              which instructed it to accept Alternate Steering Commands
              from the AGC rather than the default steering commands
              from the LVDC/LVDA.&nbsp; Thus, the AGC could steer the
              Saturn IVB (but not some of the other Saturn stages) by
              this mechanism.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, it was also desirable for the spacecraft to be
              able to monitor the activity of the Saturn, even under
              normal conditions when the LVDC was controlling the
              rocket.&nbsp; Since the spacecraft had its own Inertial
              Measurement Unit (IMU), it knew its own orientation and
              acceleration — and hence the Saturn's — at all times, and
              the AGC could integrate these quantities to know the
              velocity and position at all times.&nbsp; Thus it was not
              necessary for the IU to communicate that information to
              the spacecraft in order for the AGC to monitor the
              physical motion of the rocket and to display it for the
              astronauts on the DSKY.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I actually have an interesting graphic of the monitoring
              process to show you.&nbsp; Even though we do not have the
              original LVDC "flight program" software at the present
              time, and thus cannot simulate the operation of the LVDC
              in a digital sense, a fellow named Riley Rainey has used
              the equations defining the IU to model the physical
              behavior of the rocket and the spacecraft's IMU, allowing
              Virtual AGC to monitor the launch behavior on a simulated
              DSKY.&nbsp; Here's a short movie he has created of that
              simulation.&nbsp; It's admittedly a little fuzzy, since I
              blew it up by about 2×, but perhaps we'll be able to get a
              better one sometime in the future:</p>
            <div align="center"> <a
                href="RileyRainey/ApolloA%202009-08-05%2022-43-27-68-1200x800-20.mp4"><img

            <br>
            Of course, at the left in the video, you can see the
            simulated FDAI and DSKY.&nbsp; At the right, you can see
            telemetry from the AGC.&nbsp; You'll notice that at the
            beginning of the movie, the DSKY's UPLINK indicator is
            on.&nbsp; That's apparently because Riley's simulated DSKY
            (which is his own, and not the simulated DSKY we provide)
            isn't fully functional in the sense of accepting keypad
            input, so Riley is instead feeding the AGC commands via the
            digital uplink.<br>

    <h2><a name="LVDC_Documentation" id="LVDC_Documentation"></a>LVDC
      Documentation</h2>
    Sadly, documentation we've been able to collect for the LVDC lags
    far behind that of the AGC or even that of the Abort Guidance
    System, though it's getting better over time.&nbsp; What little
    survives that we have been able to access can be found in our <a
      href="links.html#LVDC">Document Library</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I'm also told that there are a number of published (but not
    necessarily free-of-charge) research papers about the LVDC.&nbsp;
    These may be of assistance if you're an enthusiast, but I cannot
    provide any of them for you, for legal reasons.&nbsp; Specifically,
    you can go to <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/">the AIAA's website</a>,
    and search for "LVDC".&nbsp; Or as another example, via the IEEE's
    website, you can get an article about the "<a
      href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5388320">Interactive


























      Saturn Flight Program Simulator</a>", as pointed out to me by one
    of the article's authors.&nbsp; (Thanks, Tom Dillon!)<br>
    <h2><a name="Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software"
        id="Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software"></a>The Flight Software</h2>
    Some useful things to know about the LVDC's software:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><i>The </i><i>name</i><i> of the program</i>.&nbsp; Beginning
        with Apollo 12, the code had apparently been rejiggered somewhat
        to make it more-easily reusable from mission to mission.&nbsp;
        This "flexible" version was called the GFP (Generalized Flight
        Program).&nbsp; We don't really know that it was called prior to
        that, and it may have been referred to simply as the "flight
        program" or the "LVDC flight program".<br>
      </li>
      <li><i>The revisions of the program</i>.&nbsp; We don't really
        know anything yet about how many revisions of the flight
        software were created, how those revisions were designated, and
        which revisions of the flight software were used in which
        missions.&nbsp; It may be that the released versions of the
        program were simply labeled with the mission for which they were
        targeted.<br>
      </li>
      <li><i>Was the software classified?</i>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Or at
        least it was not classified at the time period from which we
        begin to have any information.&nbsp; Several people associated
        with the development have stated to me that it was
        classified.&nbsp; But classified material must be stamped with
        one of the designations <tt>CONFIDENTIAL</tt>, <tt>SECRET</tt>,
        or <tt>TOP SECRET</tt>.&nbsp; The available software listings
        are not so stamped, and therefore should not be considered
        classified.&nbsp; Undoubtedly IBM Federal Systems Division
        considered it confidential at the time, under the common usage
        of the word, but that doesn't make it classified.<br>

    To a computer programmer, the most important thing about any
    computer program is its source code, and at present a single
    revision of the flight program is available to us.&nbsp; It is an
    engineering revision of the software, mid-way between the software
    for AS-205 and AS-206, from 1967 (I am told), and labeled as
    "AS-206RAM LVDC FLIGHT PROGRAM".&nbsp; If you Google this, you may
    unnecessarily excite yourself by noting that Saturn IB launch
    vehicle AS-206 was used for the Skylab 2 mission
    (Conrad/Weitz/Kerwin).&nbsp; You may then be chagrined to realize
    that the Skylab 2 mission was in 1973, far past the 1967 time frame
    in which this revision of the program is developed.&nbsp; What
    gives?&nbsp; The answer, is that AS-206 was originally intended for
    an unmanned mission that was canceled after the Apollo 1 fire.&nbsp;
    So whatever software the LVDC had when AS-206 eventually launched as
    Skylab 2, is not <i>this</i> software.&nbsp; That doesn't alter the
    fact that this software is the predecessor of the revisions that
    followed it.<br>
    <br>
    As far as an AS-206RAM mission specifically is concerned, we have
    the document "<a href="Documents/19680007324.pdf">AS-206 S-IVB
      RESTART ALTERNATE MISSION LAUNCH VEHICLE OPERATIONAL FLIGHT
      TRAJECTORY</a>", which I expect would be pretty invaluable in
    understanding the expected operation of the flight program.&nbsp; To
    quote the document itself,<br>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <blockquote><small>The basic purpose of the Apollo Saturn 206 S-IVB
        Restart Alternate Mission is to place the S-IVB stage into orbit
        and test
        its restart capability, simulating the AS-501 mission profile.
        In the event
        S-IVB restart problems occur in the early Saturn V flights, this
        mission
        will be flown to help correct or solve the problems. The primary
        objective
        of the SA-206 Launch Vehicle is to insert the S-IVB/IU/Payload
        configuration
        into a near earth 100 nautical mile circular orbit. The payload
        consists of
        a Spacecraft LM Adapter (SLA) and a 25° Nose Cone (NC #2).</small><br>
    </blockquote>
    As usual in these matters, what <i>we</i> have is not the punch
    cards on which the assembly-language source code was originally
    provided to the assembler program, but the "assembly listing" output
    by the assembler.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the status of the assembly
    process for it found 41 warnings and 7 errors — meaning that there
    were problems in the source code and that the assembly process <i>failed</i>.&nbsp;




    Thus the program wouldn't actually work as-is anyway, even assuming
    we had an LVDC or a simulation of an LVDC in which to run it.&nbsp;
    That doesn't reduce its instructional value any, though, and it
    doesn't mean that some enterprising individual couldn't fix it up
    now to make it work!<br>
    <br>

    </div>
    <br>
    When I say "we" have a copy of this assembly listing, however,
    there's an unfortunate proviso.&nbsp; In the U.S. there is something
    called the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which
    prevents export of certain technologies from the U.S. except under
    strict controls.&nbsp; Under my non-expert, non-lawyer reading of
    the ITAR, the LVDC would be such a device whose export is
    prohibited.&nbsp; However, I cannot personally figure out whether
    the LVDC's <i>software</i> would also therefore be
    restricted.&nbsp; If it were restricted, then freely providing the
    software online would be regarded as "exporting" it, and would
    therefore also be prohibited!<br>
    <br>
    Yes, I know that all sounds very silly, since there haven't been any
    Saturns since 1973, so nobody is likely to load one of them up with
    a warhead and fire it at anybody ... and never would have anyway,
    due to the tremendous cost involved.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the law is
    the law.&nbsp; Until this uncertainty about the ITAR status of the
    LVDC software is cleared up, I am forced to regard it as being
    restricted.&nbsp; According to wikipedia, that means that I am
    allowed to give it to only a "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_person">United
      States person</a>".&nbsp; Therefore, if you want the program
    listing, you must apply to me personally (email address at the
    bottom of the page), and provide <a
href="https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/proof-us-citizenship-and-identification-when-applying-a-job">proof





      to me</a> that you are a United States person as just described.
    Be aware that I will retain a record of everyone to whom I the
    program listing, including a digital form of the evidence you
    provided.&nbsp; I apologize for the necessity of handling it like
    this.<br>
    <br>
    Anyone who can give me a competent legal opinion about whether or
    not the LVDC source code is restricted as I fear, or who can outline
    the hoops I'd need to jump through to get an official ruling on the
    matter, <i>please</i> do so!<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    With all that unpleasantness out of the way, it doesn't seem to me
    that suitably-abridged subsets of the assembly listing would be
    restricted by ITAR, if they do not pertain to guidance, control, or
    other technical aspects of the launch vehicle.&nbsp; Here are
    various images of pages of the assembly listing that illustrate
    things like how constants and variables are defined by the software,
    how some standard mathematical functions are encoded, and some of
    the tabular data generated by the assembler:<br>

    There's some additional <a href="#ANATOMY">description of the
      anatomy of these assembly listings</a> farther down on this page.<br>
    <p>The middle group of pages above shows a few auxiliary subroutines
      for computing the sine, cosine, arctangent, and spare root
      functions, plus a 3×3 matrix-multiply routine.&nbsp; Note that
      these are some of the very algorithms described in section 13 of <a
href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Documents/satinstunitibm_5.pdf">the
        EDD (LVDC Equation Defining Document)</a>, so the source code
      can actually be compared to the defining documentation if one so
      desired.&nbsp; The two images at the top show an area of the
      program where some constants are defined, while the two at the
      bottom show a portion of the assembly listing's cross-reference
      table.&nbsp; The snapshots are a bit tricky to read, so for at
      least the middle group of pages you can alternately look at my
      first attempt of <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM/sample-1967.lvdc">a
        transcription to pure source code</a>.&nbsp; The actual LVDC
      syntax doesn't quite match what I had imagined and thus what the
      assembler (<a href="#yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler">see below</a>)
      supports right now, especially in the area of constant/variable
      allocation.&nbsp; It may be quite a while before any trial
      assemblies of the partial code can be performed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, each of the flown Saturns is associated with a
      report known as its "launch vehicle flight evaluation report", and
      <a href="links.html#lvfea">these reports are available for <i>most</i>
        of the missions</a>, though there are a few gaps.&nbsp; Chapter
      2 of each of the reports divides the mission into a set of "time
      bases", called T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>5</sub>, T<sub>5A</sub>,
      T<sub>6</sub>, ..., T<sub>9</sub>, and each time base itself
      consists of a series of events that are supposed to occur at
      different times.&nbsp; For example, time base T<sub>0</sub> is
      always the "Guidance Reference Release", and comprises events such
      as "S-IC Engine Start Sequence Command", "S-IC Engine No. 1
      Start", and so on.&nbsp; But in general, not all missions use all
      of the time bases, and the time bases aren't necessarily used for
      the same thing on different missions.<sub><br>
      </sub></p>
    As noted above, we're pretty sure that for Apollo 12 and beyond, a
    single Generalized Flight Program (GFP) was used, but we have no
    good information about preceding missions.&nbsp; By examining the
    time bases on a mission-by-mission basis, it's possible to roughly
    deduce which missions <i>may</i> have flown with the same LVDC
    software (though with differing preloaded constants) vs the missions
    which must necessarily have used a different revision of the LVDC
    software.&nbsp; Thanks to Nik Beug for pointing this out.&nbsp;
    While such an analysis has not been done comprehensively, a rough
    analysis of the gross similarities in the time bases might indicate
    the need for at least the following additional LVDC software
    revisions other than the GFP:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>... prior? ...<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-501 (Apollo 4)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-502 (Apollo 6)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-503 (Apollo 8)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-504 (Apollo 9)<br>
      </li>
      <li>AS-505 and 506 (Apollo 10-11)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding preloaded constants for LVDC memory, all missions (I
      think!) were associated with a report called the "launch vehicle
      operational flight trajectory", and these documents (among other
      things) listed the LVDC preload settings.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
      most of these reports are presently unavailable, though <a
        href="links.html#Miscellaneous_Mission_Documents">we do have a
        few of them</a>.&nbsp; For example, the AS-202 report says that
      "LVDC symbol" T<sub>1i</sub>, the time-to-go for first IGM stage,
      is preloaded with 299.25 sec, while Vex<sub>1</sub>, the J2
      exhaust velocity for first IGM stage, is loaded with 4165.45
      m/sec, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    The LVDC is a descendant of the <a href="Gemini.html">onboard
      computer used in the Gemini spacecraft</a>, which is to say the
    Gemini equivalent of the AGC.&nbsp; While the Gemini computer is
    certainly different than the LVDC, there are striking similarities
    as well that point to a family resemblance.<br>

    Among these, it would be fair to state that reference #3 was used
    primarily (the instruction set is covered in table 2-8 on pp. 2-16
    through 2-20), and the others were used to cross-check or to provide
    guidance or information missing from reference #3.&nbsp; (In
    retrospect, however, I would recommend reference #4 as a better
    starting point to those readers who don't find <i>my</i> musings
    amusing, though it does not cover the instruction set.)&nbsp; Where
    there were discrepancies between earlier documents and later
    documents, the later documents were treated as definitive.

        width="1371"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"> The illustration above shows a
        simplified block diagram of the LVDC.&nbsp; The device itself
        was designed and manufactured by IBM.&nbsp; Mechanically, the
        LVDC had dimensions of about 29.5"×12.5"×10.5", and weighed
        about 72.5 pounds.&nbsp; A number of different power supplies
        were needed:&nbsp; +6V, -3V, +12V, and +20V, at roughly
        150W.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        However, the LVDC and the Launch Vehicle Data Adapter (LVDA)
        really operated as a pair, and neither is of use without the
        other, so in considering the mechanical and electrical
        characteristics of the LVDC one really needs to include those of
        those of the LVDA into their thinking.&nbsp; The LVDA had
        dimensions of about TBD"×TBD"×TBD", and weighed about 214
        pounds.&nbsp; Its electrical budget was about 320W and it
        accepted +28V power.&nbsp; The purpose of the LVDA was basically
        to intermediate between the LVDC and the remainder of the
        rocket.<br>
        <br>
        In computer terms, LVDC had the following characteristics:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The computer was triply redundant, with 3 identical
            circuits conforming to the block diagram shown above.&nbsp;
            There was a "voting" circuit not shown, and any two of the 3
            sub-systems could outvote the other on every output control
            signal.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory was ferrite core and was entirely RAM.&nbsp; In
            other words, there was no ROM memory as there was in the
            AGC.&nbsp; This meant that the flight program could
            theoretically be changed much closer to flight time than
            could the program of the AGC, but it also meant that the
            program contained within the computer could be destroyed
            much more easily than with the AGC.&nbsp; (But remember, the
            operating life of the LVDC was very short compared to that
            of the AGC.)&nbsp; Actually, reading RAM based on ferrite
            cores is inherently destructive, so every read must be
            accompanied by a write-back operation to restore the
            contents of memory.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory words were 28 bits, with 2 of those bits being for
            parity, and thus the data portion of memory words was only
            26 bits.&nbsp; Memory was accessed serially, at a 512K
            bits/second rate, though this fact is not relevant as far as
            software coding is concerned.</li>
          <li>Each memory word was logically subdivided into two 14-bit
            "syllables" (13 data bits + 1 parity bit), and computer
            instructions were encoded in 13 bits.&nbsp; Therefore, each
            memory word could hold two computer instructions, one in
            each syllable.&nbsp; Data, on the other hand, required a
            complete word.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The total amount of memory varied from mission to mission,
            I believe.&nbsp; The LVDC could be populated with up to 8
            modules of memory, with each module comprising 16 "sectors"
            of 256 words each (4096 words), for a maximum of 32768
            words.&nbsp; One word in each block wasn't memory as such
            but was a mirror of the CPU's Product-Quotient Register (see
            below), so the usable memory in each block was really only
            4095 words.&nbsp;<br>
          </li>
          <li>Memory could be operated in two different modes, under
            program control, called "simplex" and "duplex".&nbsp; In
            "duplex" mode, the memory was divided into two banks, each
            of which was an identical mirror of the other in order to
            improve reliability, whereas in "simplex" mode the memory
            wasn't redundant in this way (though it was still triply
            redundant as mentioned above) but the number of memory words
            was double.&nbsp; In duplex mode, the odd-numbered modules
            mirrored the even-numbered modules, so that one would
            typically used only modules 0, 2, 4, and 6 in duplex mode.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The basic CPU clock was 2048 KHz, but computer
            instructions were executed in a "computer cycle" time, which
            was about 82μs.&nbsp; Although most instructions took a
            single computer cycle, some instructions (particularly
            multiplication and division) took longer.&nbsp; The longest
            instruction, <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPH</span>, took 5 cycles.&nbsp;
            The <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
            instructions (see below) theoretically took only a single
            cycle, but could only begin their operations in that amount
            of time, and the results weren't accessible until later (4
            cycles total for <span style="font-family: Courier
              New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and 8 cycles total for
            <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>).<br>
          </li>
          <li>Arithmetic was 2's complement, integer only.</li>
          <li>There were two arithmetic units, one of which could
            perform addition, subtractions, and logical operations,
            whilst the other could perform multiplication and
            division.&nbsp; The two units could be operated
            independently, which is significant because multiplications
            required 4 computer cycles and divisions required 8 computer
            cycles, and instruction execution could continue while the
            multiplication or division proceeded.&nbsp; In other words,
            one could begin a multiplication or division, proceed to
            execute some unrelated instructions, and then later fetch
            the results of completed multiplication or division.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    The CPU had the following additional registers not addressable as
    normal memory:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Accumulator Register.</li>
      <li>The Product-Quotient Register (or just P-Q Register) can be
        accessed at address 0775 (octal) regardless of which memory
        modules and sectors were currently selected.&nbsp; (This happens
        to be an address in the "residual sector", as described below,
        so it represents a single address in each memory module rather
        than an address within each memory sector.)&nbsp; However, it is
        used by the <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">MPY</span> and <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIV</span>
        instructions (see below) and therefore cannot be treated as an
        ordinary memory location.</li>
      <li>The HOP Register, discussed further below.</li>
      <li>... and various hidden registers not directly relevant to
        software:&nbsp; the Transfer Register, the Address Register, the
        Data Module Register, the Data Sector Register, the Instruction
        Sector Register, the Operation Code Register, and the Memory
        Buffer Registers.</li>
    </ul>
    There are some memory words in the "residual sector" (see below)
    that are real memory (unlike 0775), but nevertheless have special
    purposes and so should be avoided for general usage:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>0400 stores a HOP Register code (see below) for vectoring to
        interrupts.<br>
      </li>
      <li>0600, 0640, 0700, 0740 are used for the <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
        instruction (see below).</li>
      <li>0776, 0777 are used for the "HOP save" feature (see below).</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, address 000—I believe, in module 0 sector 0 but am not
    sure—stores a HOP Register code loaded at reset.<br>
    <h3><a name="Layout_of_Memory_Words" id="Layout_of_Memory_Words"></a>Layout
of



























      Memory Words</h3>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 896px; height:
        166px;" alt="" src="LVDC-BitPositions.jpg" height="166"
        width="896"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The illustration above depicts the data organization within a memory
    word.&nbsp;&nbsp; For numeric data, there is a sign bit (designated
    "S" in the illustration), with the bit labeled "1" being the
    most-significant bit and the bit labeled "25" being the
    least-significant bit.&nbsp; For non-numeric data, the bits were
    designated instead as "1" through "26", with no overlap between the
    designation of the bits for numeric data.&nbsp; A very curious
    system indeed, in modern thinking!<br>
    <br>
    The situation is even curiouser, to paraphrase Alice, when
    considering instructions stored in the syllables in place of numeric
    data.&nbsp; In those cases the bits are interpreted as in the
    following illustration:<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 899px; height:
        169px;" alt="" src="LVDC-InstructionPositions.jpg" height="169"
        width="899"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The instruction in Syllable 0 is processed first, and the
    instruction in Syllable 1 is processed second.&nbsp; In most cases,
    the bits labeled OP1-OP4 contain an instruction code and the bits
    A1-A9 contain an address in the range 0-511 on which the instruction
    operates.&nbsp; There are, however, a few instructions in which A9
    and/or A8 also form a part of the instruction code, in which case
    the addressable range is smaller.&nbsp; Note that bits A1-A9 are
    neither in consecutive order, nor are they in an order which would
    be consistent with the ordering of bits in data words.<br>
    <br>
    These oddities in bit-ordering are due to the fact that memory was
    read serially into the CPU, so the ordering of the bits is optimized
    to mimic the order in which the CPU needed to use them.<br>
    <br>
    For the purpose of executing instructions, memory is considered as
    being divided into "sectors" of 256 words each.&nbsp; Address bits
    A1-A8 select an offset into a sector, while A9 (known as the
    "residual bit") selects which sector is being addressed.&nbsp; When
    A9 is 0, the currently-selected sector is being addressed, while
    when A9 is 1 a special sector called the "residual sector" is being
    addressed.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The "residual
      sector" is always sector 017 (octal) in the current memory module</span>.&nbsp;
Incidentally,



























    the "residual sector" can only be used for addressing memory, and
    there's no way to access instructions in it unless it happens to be
    the currently-selected instruction sector as explained in the
    paragraph that follows.&nbsp; In essence, the "residual sector" is
    good for storing global variables whilst the currently-selected data
    sector is good for storing local variables.<br>
    <br>
    Memory-sector selection and the "residual sector" become clearer
    when contemplating the HOP Register mentioned earlier:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 868px; height:
        293px;" alt="" src="LVDC-HopRegister.jpg" height="293"
        width="868"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The meanings of these fields are probably clear to you, but just in
    case they are not:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Bits IM1-IM3 (not contiguous) select the memory module from
        which instructions are fetched.&nbsp; (Recall that there are up
        to 8 memory modules installed in the LVDC.)</li>
      <li>Bit DUPIN selects whether the portion of memory from which
        instructions are fetched is accessed in duplex mode or in
        simplex mode.&nbsp; (Recall that in duplex mode there is only
        half the addressable memory as in simplex mode, because the
        memory is dual-redundant and half of the memory mirrors the
        other half.)</li>
      <li>Bits IS1-IS4 select the 256-word sector within the selected
        memory module from which instructions are fetched.</li>
      <li>Bits A1-A8 (the Instruction Counter) point to the next
        instruction word to be fetched from the selected sector in the
        selected block.</li>
      <li>Bit SYL indicates the next instruction syllable in the next
        instruction word.</li>
      <li>And similarly, bits DM1-DM3, bit DUPDN, and bits DS1-DS4 serve
        analogous purposes except for data words rather than instruction
        words.</li>
    </ul>
    Upon reset, the CPU loads the HOP Register with the value stored at
    address 000 (presumably in memory module 0 sector 0), and this
    determines where program execution starts.<br>
    <br>
    Below are some photos sent to us by Dmitris Vitoris of an LVDC "page
    assembly", which I suppose (but am not sure) is a memory
    module.&nbsp; (I'm not really sure which is the best photo, so I've
    just included them all.)<br>

              <li>0775 (octal) stores into the Product-Quotient register
                rather than to normal memory.</li>
              <li>0776 (octal) stores the contents of the
                multiplicand-divisor register (rather than the
                accumulator) to address 0776.</li>
              <li>0777 (octal) stores the contents of the
                multiplicand-divisor register (rather than the
                accumulator) to address 0777.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the description of 0776 and 0777 above is quite
              misleading.&nbsp; For one thing, the way the
              multiplication and division instructions work, the inputs
              to those operations (multiplicand, multiplier, dividend,
              divisor) are all supplied in the accumulator and memory
              locations anyway, so why would you need an instruction to
              separately access the multiplicand or divisor?&nbsp; The
              answer is that this feature has nothing at all to do with
              multiplication and division, but is instead crucial to
              storing return addresses in subroutines and interrupts!<br>
            </p>
            <p>The explanation is this:&nbsp; During the process of
              executing any given LVDC instruction, a HOP constant for
              the LVDC instruction at the <i>next successive memory
                address</i> is formed.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the next
              instruction successively in memory is not necessarily the
              next instruction sequentially executed in time.&nbsp;
              Whatever the next instruction executed — unless it happens
              to be a multiplication or division (<tt>MPY</tt>, <tt>MPH</tt>,
              <tt>DIV</tt>) — the previously-generated HOP constant is
              temporarily shoved into multiplicand-divisor
              register.&nbsp; Thus if the very next instruction executed
              is <tt>STO 776</tt> or <tt>STO 777</tt> (and the
              previous instruction was <i>not</i> <tt>MPY</tt>, <tt>MPH</tt>,
              or <tt>DIV</tt>), what ends up getting stored in location
              776 or 777 is not a multiplicand or divisor, but rather
              the HOP constant for the memory address that numerically
              follows the <i>previously executed</i> instruction.&nbsp;
              Which is not useful at all when instructions are simply
              executing sequentially, but is useful whenever there is a
              transfer of control because the code to which control has
              been transferred can use it to access its own return
              address ... and there is no other painless method provided
              in the instruction set to do so.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><b>In other words, in a subroutine or interrupt-service
                  routine, the very first instruction should be a </b><b>
                </b><b><tt>STO 776</tt></b><b> or </b><b><tt>STO 777</tt></b><b>
                  to save the HOP constant for the return address.&nbsp;
                  Conversely, the instruction for returning from the
                  subroutine or interrupt is a matching </b><b><tt>HOP
                    776</tt></b><b> or </b><b><tt>HOP</tt></b><b><tt>
                    777</tt></b><b> instruction.</b><br>

            This instruction takes an instruction stored at a specified
            memory location, forms a modified A1-A9 field for that
            instruction, executes that instruction, and then continues
            with the next instruction following the <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
            (unless the program counter has been modified).&nbsp; For
            this instruction, A8 and A9 form a part of the instruction
            code, so only A1-A7 are significant.&nbsp; Only 4 different
            target words are allowed, 0600, 0640, 0700, and 0740, and
            they are all in the "residual sector".&nbsp; Many of the
            bits in A1-A7 represent various types of modifications to
            the embedded address at the target address rather than being
            address bits themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the
            interpretations of bits A1-A7 in the <span
              style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
            instruction:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A4 modify the address embedded in the target
                instruction as described below.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A5 indicates the syllable in which the target
                instruction resides.</li>
              <li>A7,A6 selects the target address, as follows:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>0,0 for target address 0600</li>
                <li>0,1 for target address 0640</li>
                <li>1,0 for target address 0700</li>
                <li>1,1 for target address 0740</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            When the target instruction is executed, its A1-A9 bits are
            formed as follows:<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>A1-A2 come from A1-A2 of the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EXM</span>
                instruction.</li>
              <li>A3 is the logical OR of the A3 of the target
                instruction and A3 of the <span style="font-family:
                  Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
                instruction.</li>
              <li>A4 is the logical OR of the A4 of the target
                instruction and A4 of the <span style="font-family:
                  Courier New,Courier,monospace;">EXM</span>
                instruction.</li>
              <li>A5-A8 come from A5-A8 of the target instruction.</li>
            </ul>
            The data sector used when the target instruction is executed
            is also changed for the duration of that one instruction, as
            determined by bits A1, A2, and A9 of the unmodified target
            instruction, as follows:<br>

    <h3><a name="Subroutine_Linkage" id="Subroutine_Linkage"></a>Subroutine



























      Linkage</h3>
    While the LVDC is executing an instruction, it is also forming the
    HOP constant of the next instruction in sequence—i.e., on the
    assumption that no branch occurs—and this HOP constant is available
    to the next instruction that executes.&nbsp; In most cases, this
    means that an instruction can find out its own address (which isn't
    very interesting), but if the previous instruction was a branch then
    it means that the current instruction can determine the address of
    the instruction in sequence that followed the branch instruction,
    and thus can use this information for setting up returns from
    subroutines.&nbsp; The instruction for fetching that HOP constant
    and saving it is either <span style="font-family: courier
      new,courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
      style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>.&nbsp;
Only



























    those special addresses work.&nbsp; So a typical subroutine linkage
    would look like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"> <span style="font-family: courier
        new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        TRA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MYSUB<br>
      </span> </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family: courier
        new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
        return to here ...<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
        <br>
        MYSUB&nbsp;&nbsp; STO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        0776&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # or, STO 0777<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do stuff ...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        HOP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0776&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # or, HOP
        0777<br>
      </span> </div>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="Interrupts" id="Interrupts"></a>Interrupts</h3>
    There are up to 12 external interrupt sources, buffered by the
    LVDA.&nbsp; Upon any of these becoming active, the LVDA generates a
    master interrupt signal to the LVDC.&nbsp; When the LVDC receives
    the master interrupt signal, assuming that interrupts have not been
    programmatically inhibited, the following actions occur:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The LVDC automatically masks that particular interrupt from
        occurring again until explicitly reenabled (at step 9 below).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The LVDC allows any instruction, multiplication, or division
        in progress to complete.</li>
      <li>The LVDC performs a <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>, thus transferring
        control to an interrupt-service routine—or, as the original
        documents refer to it, an "input-output subprogram".&nbsp;
        Recall that this does not jump to address 0400, rather it loads
        the HOP Register from the value stored at address 0400, and this
        can be used to jump to a location, set the current memory module
        and sector, etc.&nbsp; (Early non-flight hardware seemingly used
        a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP
          0776</span> instead of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0400</span>.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>
        instruction executed by the interrupt service routine must be
        either <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0777</span>
        to store the pre-interrupt value of the HOP Register at either
        address 0776 or 0777.&nbsp; (There is some ambiguity as to
        whether 0776 and 0777 are really separate memory words, or
        whether they represent a single memory word with two separate
        addresses.&nbsp; I will suppose the former until more
        information becomes available.&nbsp; If location 0777 is used,
        compatibility with earlier hardware documentation is assured.)</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then save any registers
        or common memory locations that were going to be altered into
        local storage.&nbsp; In almost all cases, one would suppose that
        the accumulator needed to be stored.&nbsp; If multiplications or
        divisions would be used, the P-Q Register would also need to be
        saved, presumably with a pair of instructions like <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">CLA 0775</span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        from the Interrupt Storage input port to determine which of the
        12 interrupt sources are active, so that it can vector to an
        appropriate service routine for it.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should then do whatever
        computations it needed to do.</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should restore the registers it
        had saved (<span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">CLA <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span></span>
        followed by <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">STO 0775</span> to restore the P-Q
        Register, if necessary, followed by a restoration of the
        accumulator).</li>
      <li>The interrupt service routine should do a <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span>
        to the Interrupt Register Reset output port, with just the
        specific bit set corresponding to the interrupt type being
        processed, to reenable that specific interrupt.&nbsp; The
        particular flavor of <span style="font-family: Courier
          New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> performed should, of
        course, take the Data Source from memory rather than from the
        accumulator, since at this point the accumulator has already
        been restored to its pre-interrupt condition.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The return from interrupt is either <span style="font-family:
          Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0776</span> or <span
          style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">HOP 0777</span>,
        depending on which location the HOP constant had been stored on
        entry to the interrupt service routine.</li>
    </ol>
    Interrupts can be programmatically masked or unmasked with <span
      style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">PIO</span> to
    Interrupt Inhibit.&nbsp; By setting a bit in Interrupt Inhibit
    corresponding to the interrupt whose masking is desired, that
    interrupt is thereby masked.&nbsp; Any combination of bits can be
    set, so any combination of interrupts can be masked.&nbsp; To
    reenable the interrupt, a 0 is written to the corresponding bit in
    Interrupt Inhibit.<br>
    <br>
    The available interrupts, and their bitwise positioning in the i/o
    registers mentioned above, differed for the Saturn IB rocket (Apollo
    7, ASTP, Skylab) vs. the Saturn V rocket (Apollo 8-17).&nbsp; The
    Saturn IB and Saturn V descriptions below were taken from different
    documents (namely, <a
      href="Documents/MSFC-MAN-206-SkylabSaturnIBFlightManual.pdf"> <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Skylab Saturn IB Flight Manual</span></a>
    p. 6-21 and <a style="font-style: italic;"
      href="Documents/MSFC-MAN-503-SaturnFlightManual-SA503.pdf"> Saturn
      Flight Manual, SA-503</a> p. 7-21, respectively), and if one
    accounts for the differences in language between the two documents,
    the interrupts are almost entirely the same. I've marked the ones in
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red</span> that seem different
    to me, as well as any other points of particular difficulty for me.<br>

Assembly



























      Language</h2>
    Unfortunately, there is no surviving manual or other reference
    describing the syntax of LVDC assembly language, nor the pseudo-ops
    available in it.&nbsp; This section is actually a kind of running
    diary of what I infer about those things from evaluating the
    available LVDC source code, and shouldn't be taken as authoritative
    in any way.&nbsp; There's not too much organization of the topics in
    this section just yet, but I hope to be able to provide a better
    structure later, after I manage to get a more-solid grasp on the
    syntax.<br>
    <br>
    You'll probably also need to refer to the previous <a
      href="#CPU_Instructions">discussion of the CPU instructions</a>
    from time to time, in order to follow the discussion.<br>
    <br>
    Here are some of my takeaways:<br>
    <br>
    <i>Empty lines</i>:&nbsp; Are ignored by the assembler.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Code comments</i>:&nbsp; Full-line comments seem to be prefixed
    by the character '*' in column 1.&nbsp; Anything left over at the
    end of a line after the beginning of a line has been parsed seems to
    be treated as a comment, and doesn't require any '*' prefix.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Character set</i>:&nbsp; Upper-case alphabetic, numeric, and some
    punctuation.&nbsp; This isn't really any great surprise, of course,
    if you reflect that all of the source code was supplied on computer
    punch cards to the IBM/360 mainframe computer which ran the
    assembler program, and that the character sets supported by keypunch
    machines did not include lower-case characters anyway.&nbsp; Douglas
    Jones has written a fun <a
      href="http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/%7Ejones/cards/index.html">exploration















      of punch cards</a>, if you're interested in that kind of
    thing.&nbsp; (By the way, I've heard anecdotally that the executable
    program which was output by the assembly of the LVDC software was
    punched into a long mylar tape, perhaps 1.5" wide, which was then
    transported by the coders themselves to Marshall Space Flight
    Center, where the mylar tape was put into a tape reader which
    transferred the program into the ferrite-core memory of the LVDC
    itself.&nbsp; This was possible because, as you may recall from
    above, all of the ferrite cores in the LVDC were both readable <i>and</i>
    writable.&nbsp; This contrasts to the AGC, in which the program was
    stored in read-only memory which had to be <i>manufactured</i>
    rather than simply written to.&nbsp; So installing the software in
    the LVDC was a far less painful, less expensive, much quicker
    process than installing software in the AGC.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>Symbols</i> (names of variables, constants, subroutines,
    ...):&nbsp; 6 characters or less, alphanumeric, with the leading
    character alphabetic.<br>
    <br>
    <i>The </i><i><tt>CALL</tt></i><i> macro</i>:&nbsp; <tt>CALL</tt>
    is used as in source code as if it were a CPU instruction, but it is
    not.&nbsp; I think of it as a macro for the common operation of
    calling a subroutine having a single input argument.&nbsp; An
    "instruction" of the form "<tt>CALL <i>ARG1</i>,<i>ARG2</i></tt>"
    is otherwise ignored but is replaced by a pair of actual
    instructions, <br>
    <blockquote><tt>CLA <i>ARG2</i></tt><br>
      <tt>HOP* <i>ARG1<br>
        </i></tt></blockquote>
    All three lines appear in assembly listings, but the <tt>CALL</tt>
    is treated as a comment and the other two have a '+' character
    printed next to them to show (I suppose) that they're there due to
    the expansion of the macro.&nbsp; Whether this macro is hard-coded
    into the original assembler, or whether there's a general-purpose
    macro facility (i.e., whether the <tt>CALL</tt> macro is defined
    programmatically elsewhere in the source code), I have no way to
    know.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Literal numerical constants</i>:&nbsp; These seem to follow the
    same rules as for AGC.&nbsp; (E.g., generally octal, but decimal if
    containing a decimal point.&nbsp; Allows suffixes like "<tt>E</tt><tt><i>n</i></tt>"
    for powers of 10, "<tt>B<i>n</i></tt>" for binary scaling, or both.)<br>
    <br>
    <i>Format of an instruction line</i>:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Columns 1-6:&nbsp; Optional symbol, supplying a name for the
        memory location of the current line of code.&nbsp; The original
        coders apparently called these "left-hand symbols".</li>
      <li>Columns 8-15:&nbsp; The name of the CPU instruction (or <tt>CALL</tt>).&nbsp;

















        Notice that this is <i>not</i> aligned with what is sometimes
        thought of as the default position of a "tab stop", which would
        have been at column 9.</li>
      <li>Columns 16-28:&nbsp; The CPU instruction's operand. I'll talk
        more about these operands below.<br>
      </li>
      <li>29-75:&nbsp; Comment, possibly blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>75-80:&nbsp; Sequence number, consisting of 6 decimal
        digits.&nbsp; The sequence numbers are unique, and in increasing
        order from one line to the next.&nbsp; All the examples I've
        seen are multiples of 10, though I'm sure that it's possible to
        have sequence numbers in between as well.&nbsp; In the assembly
        listing, the sequence number doesn't seem to appear on blank
        lines, nor on <tt>CLA</tt>/<tt>HOP*</tt> lines expanded from
        the <tt>CALL</tt> macro.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Instruction operands</i>:&nbsp; Operand formats differ for
      some CPU instruction types, but most of them require a variable (a
      word in data memory), and conform to a pattern in which there are
      3 allowed variants for specifying the operand:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A literal 3-digit octal number (such as 777 or 776), which is
        an offset into the DM/DS (Data Module / Data Sector) defined by
        the current contents of the HOP register.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The symbolic name of a variable or constant defined elsewhere
        in the program.&nbsp; The variable/constant has to be in the
        current DM/DS, so if the referenced symbol doesn't happen to be
        located in that particular module or sector, it could be a
        problem.&nbsp; <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; The <tt>HOP*</tt>
        instruction is a slight exception, because its target operand is
        a symbol which names a subroutine ... i.e., which is in an IM/IS
        (Instruction Module / Instruction Sector) rather than the
        current DM/DS.&nbsp; It appears to me that what the assembler
        does when it encounters a <tt>HOP*</tt> is to allocate a
        variable at what it thinks is the next unused position in the
        current DM/DS, stores a HOP constant for the target symbol at
        that newly-allocated variable, and then treats that
        newly-allocated variable as the actual operand in the
        instruction.&nbsp; If the same symbol is the target of multiple
        <tt>HOP*</tt> instructions, the assembler will reuse the
        variable it has created for it.&nbsp; In contrast, the operand
        of a plain <tt>HOP</tt> instruction is already a variable in
        the DM/DS, so the assembler doesn't have to perform any
        contortions to use it.</li>
      <li>The character '=' prefixed to a literal numerical
        constant.&nbsp; It looks to me as if the assembler does
        something similar here to that it does for <tt>HOP*</tt> (see
        above):&nbsp; It allocates an unnamed variable in the current
        DM/DS, stores the value of the constant at that variable, and
        then uses the location of the new-created variable as the
        operand.&nbsp; I don't know if the assembler implements any kind
        of reusability for these unnamed variables.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Except for the <tt>HOP</tt>/<tt>HOP*</tt> instructions, the
      other CPU instructions that transfer program control target a
      location in the current IM/IS rather than a variable in the DM/DS,
      and thus require a different type of operand.&nbsp; Those
      instructiona (<tt>TRA</tt>, <tt>TNZ</tt>, <tt>TMI</tt>) thus
      have operands in one of the following two formats:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The symbolic name of a code location in the current IM/IS.</li>
      <li>"<tt>*+<i>n</i></tt>" or "<tt>*-<i>n</i></tt>", where <tt><i>n</i></tt>
        is an octal(?) constant.&nbsp; This references the memory
        location <tt><i>n</i></tt> words later or earlier than the
        current instruction, respectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other exceptions:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The shift instruction, <tt>SHF</tt>, and the shorthand
        replacements for it, <tt>SHR</tt> and <tt>SHL</tt>.&nbsp; The
        latter two shorthand instructions take either "<tt>1</tt>" or "<tt>2</tt>"
        as the operand, and thus represent logical right or left shifts
        by 1 or 2 positions.&nbsp; I assume that <tt>SHF</tt>, if ever
        used, would take a literal octal constant as its operand.</li>
      <li>The <tt>CDS</tt> instruction requires an operand of the form
        <tt><i>DM</i>,<i>DS</i>,<i>DUPDN</i></tt> where the three octal
        fields are interpreted, respectively, as specifying a
        HOP-constant-like data module (0-7), data sector (0-17), and
        duplex vs simplex mode (0-1).&nbsp; The <tt>DEQD</tt> pseudo-op
        (see below) can be used to create symbolic macro names for such
        specifications, and so the operand for <tt>CDS</tt> can be such
        a symbolic macro name as well.</li>
      <li>The <tt>EXM</tt> instruction has operands of the form "<tt><i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i></tt>",

















        where <tt><i>i</i></tt>, <tt><i>j</i></tt>, and <tt><i>k</i></tt>
        are all small integers.&nbsp; I cannot be sure, but referring to
        the description earlier of how the <tt>EXM</tt> instruction
        works, I think that these fields may be interpreted as follows:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><tt><i>i</i></tt> (0-3):&nbsp; Specifies offset in residual
          memory of target instruction:&nbsp; 0 for 600, 1 for 640, 2
          for 700, 3 for 740.<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>j</i></tt> (0-1):&nbsp; Specifies syllable of the
          target instruction within the target word.<br>
        </li>
        <li><tt><i>k</i></tt> (0-17 octal):&nbsp; Specifies modifier for
          the instruction:&nbsp; the two least-significant bits replace
          the corresponding bits in the target instruction, while the
          two most-significant bits bitwise-OR with the corresponding
          bits.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>I believe the <tt>PIO</tt> instruction accepts only literal
        octal constants.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="ANATOMY"></a><i><br>
        Anatomy of the assembly listing</i>:&nbsp; Most of what's in the
      assembly listings should be obvious from the descriptions above,
      but there are a few things that it might be helpful to have some
      additional explanation for.&nbsp; So here are my own inferences on
      the subject.&nbsp; First, consider a "normal" section of the
      listing, containing code, comments, etc., as opposed to report
      tables generated by the assembler, to which I've added some markup
      (in green) for explanatory purposes:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyCode.jpg" height="310"
        width="1005"> </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Columns IM, IS, S, LOC, DM, and DS:&nbsp; These columns are
        generated by the assembler and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">the fields of the HOP constant</a>
        associated with the line of code, from the viewpoint of the
        assembler.&nbsp; (The only HOP fields missing are DUPIN and
        DUPDN, which I suppose would be global settings affecting all
        memory, as opposed to varying on a line by line basis.)&nbsp; In
        particular, the IM and IS fields give the memory module and
        sector in which the line of code appears, and LOC gives the
        offset into the memory sector of the word in which the code for
        the instruction is stored.</li>
      <li>Columns A8-A1, A9, and OP:&nbsp; These columns are also
        generated by the assembler, and represent <a
          href="#Layout_of_Memory_Words">fields of the assembled
          instruction</a> associated with the line of code.&nbsp; In
        particular, OP is the octal value of the particular CPU
        instruction, <a href="#CPU_Instructions">as tabulated earlier</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Column CONSTANT:&nbsp; Yet another field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; Most lines don't have it, but it appears
        whenever the operand of the instruction is the address of a
        numerical constant stored at some other place in memory, but for
        which the assembler knows the value.&nbsp; For example, both of
        the lines in the sample above are the same, 342452244, because
        both of them relate to a <tt>HOP* SCPOLY</tt>
        instruction.&nbsp; As I've already explained above, what the
        assembler does with a line of code like this is to find the <tt>SCPOLY</tt>
        routine (which conveniently for us, actually appears in sample
        above as well), figures out its HOP constant, allocates a word
        of memory, stores the HOP constant at that location, and then
        embeds the address of that location into the instruction.&nbsp;
        You can actually see all that happening in the sample.&nbsp; The
        HOP constant itself corresponds to the values IM=4, IS=04, S=1,
        LOC=124, DM=2, DS=14 at the line of code <tt>SCPOLY STO 777</tt>.&nbsp;













        I know it's probably tough to do those conversions in your head,
        so a handy python script (<a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/yaASM/unHOP.py">unHOP.py</a>)
        is available that can do it for you; and in fact, if you feed
        342452244 into unHOP.py, the expected values of IM, IS, S, etc.,
        pop out.&nbsp; (You also get the extra info that DUPIN=1 and
        DUPDN=1 ... more on which below.)&nbsp; Moreover, if you look at
        the lines where the constant appears, namely the lines reading
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
          charset=UTF-8">
        <tt>HOP* SCPOLY</tt>, and you look at the assembled code, you'll
        see that the address at which the HOP constant is stored must be
        DM=2, DS=14, LOC=342.</li>
      <li>Column EXPANSION:&nbsp; The final field generated by the
        assembler.&nbsp; It contains the character '+' for instructions
        which have been expanded from the <tt>CALL</tt> macro, but is
        blank otherwise.&nbsp; Whether there are other things that can
        appear there, I can't say.</li>
      <li>Columns LEFT-HAND SYMBOL, INSTRUCTION, OPERAND, COMMENT,
        SEQUENCE:&nbsp; I've covered these above, and suspect that they
        may come directly from the punch cards, unchanged.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An interesting factoid you can deduce from the sample information
      just given is that this flight program was used on an LVDC
      configured for <u>DUPLEX</u> mode.&nbsp; We know this because
      we've just seen that DUPIN and DUPDN are 1; in SIMPLEX mode they
      would have been 0.&nbsp; Recall that there are two possible memory
      configurations, "SIMPLEX" and "DUPLEX".&nbsp; In DUPLEX mode, half
      of the memory is used to precisely mirror the other half, thus
      even though the same number of memory modules might be available
      in one as in the other, only half as much memory is actually
      accessible to the software in DUPLEX mode as in SIMPLEX
      mode.&nbsp; Perhaps that's why the S (syllable) field is always 1
      in the sample code shown.&nbsp; Recall that memory words (26 bits)
      comprise two 13 bit syllables each.&nbsp; Since instructions
      assemble to just a single syllable (4-bit OP + 1-bit A9 + 8-bit
      A8-1), you'd expect the S field to toggle from 0 to 1 and back
      again as you went from one line of code to the next.&nbsp; In
      SIMPLEX mode, they probably would, but they do not in this
      particular flight program because syllable 1 is redundant to
      syllable 0.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand ... 26-bit constants like HOP constants still
      seem to use up both syllables of the memory they're stored at, so
      perhaps there's something I'm not grasping about usage of SIMPLEX
      vs DUPLEX.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The only other pages of the assembly listing we currently have
      are from the SEGMENT CROSS REFERENCE table, which is something
      generated by the assembler:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="anatomyXref.jpg" height="74"
        width="1328"><br>
    </div>
    <p>What this does is list each symbol in the program, tell you where
      it appears in memory, and then tells you how to find all <i>uses</i>
      of that symbol in the code.&nbsp; It should be pretty obvious to
      you that in this example, the symbol <tt>UTEMP1</tt> is in memory
      module 2, sector 17, at address 174.&nbsp; It may or may not be
      obvious that where the symbol is <i>used</i> is at the line
      SEQUENCE numbers 085370, 116640, etc.&nbsp; Alas, the few pages of
      the assembly listing which I've elected to freely expose do not
      include the one which <tt>UTEMP1</tt> is allocated, but does
      include several examples of where it is used.&nbsp; For example,
      if you look at the sample code I've marked up in green just a bit
      above, you can see it used at SEQUENCE number 117600, just as
      expected.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="MIT_Instrumentation_Laboratory_vs_IBM"></a>MIT
      Instrumentation Laboratory vs IBM Federal Systems Division</h2>
    The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (which designed the Apollo
    Guidance Computer) had nothing to do with the LVDC, and conversely
    IBM Federal Systems Division (which designed the LVDC) had nothing
    to do with the AGC.&nbsp; However, since IBM was an important
    manufacturer of computers (indeed, it designed the Gemini on-board
    computer system), whereas MIT/IL was emphatically <i>not</i>, there
    was an understandable feeling by some that the Apollo program might
    better be served by an IBM on-board guidance computer in the Command
    Module and Lunar Module than by newly-designed computer from novice
    MIT/IL.<br>
    <br>
    Accordingly, IBM proposed that the LVDC be used in place of the AGC
    in the CM and LM, and in 1963, it produced a big, two volume report
    (<a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-129-Volume1.pdf">here</a>
    and <a href="Documents/IBMStudyReport-63-928-130-Volume2.pdf"> here</a>)
    to support their proposal.&nbsp; The Instrumentation Labs fired back
    their own critiques, shredding IBM's report to the extent
    possible.&nbsp; And in <a
      href="Documents/CritiqueOfIBMApolloStudyReport.pdf"> one of those
      critiques</a>, we have a few precious gems of LVDC assembly
    language, as written by the Instrumentation Labs personnel rather
    than by IBM.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Whether it's a good LVDC program or a bad one, who knows?&nbsp; It
    certainly seems to depart a tad from the syntax of actual IBM code;
    for example, what MIT calls <tt>HOPCON</tt>, IBM calls <tt>HPC</tt>.
    &nbsp; But here's what it looked like.&nbsp; The '#' characters
    indicate the beginnings of comments.&nbsp; Those comments were added
    by me, and weren't present in the samples originally.<br>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="text-align: left;"> The inclusion of this section is
        an act of pure optimism.&nbsp; Since we do not have access to
        any existing full copy of the flight software, we have little
        use for a CPU simulation.<br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 770px;
            height: 236px;" alt="" src="Saturn-GuidanceEquations.jpg"
            height="236" width="770"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        An important thing to understand, in terms of simulation, is
        that the LVDC was not fast enough to keep up with the real-time
        calculations needed to directly control the rocket.&nbsp; The
        results would have been too stair-steppy, too choppy.&nbsp; 25
        outputs per second isn't enough!&nbsp; What happened instead is
        that a separate unit — the LVD<i>A</i> — was needed to accept
        the digital outputs from the LVDC and turn them into
        smoothly-changing controls for the rocket. And when I say
        smoothly-changing, I mean both smoothly in <i>time</i> as well
        as in terms of electrical properties. Thus any decent simulation
        would require simulation of not only the LVDC but also of the
        LVDA, the latter of which is currently outside the scope of
        what's being provided here.<br>
        <br>
        An interesting aspect of the LVDC is that since it is
        essentially a "black box" that outputs real-time control signals
        in response to real-time inputs, it is possible to create a
        reasonably satisfactory behavioral simulation for it in the
        absence of the original software, if one simply knows the <a
          href="Documents/SaturnVLaunchVehicleGuidanceEquations.pdf">
          guidance equations</a> relating the outputs to the
        inputs.&nbsp; While creating behavior simulations is not an
        objective of the Virtual AGC project as far as the Apollo CPUs
        are concerned, there are people engaged in creating such
        simulations for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span>
        NASSP project and elsewhere.<br>
        <br>
        Something that would be more interesting and have a slightly
        higher degree of realism from my personal viewpoint would be to
        try and implement the guidance equations in LVDC assembly
        language, so that it could be run in <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">yaLVDC</span>, and I think the NASSP project would like
        to do that if we're every capable of obliging them.<br>

        id="yaLVDCASM_the_LVDC_Cross-Assembler"></a>yaASM, the LVDC
      Cross-Assembler</h2>
    Because of the tremendous similarity between the LVDC and <a
      href="Gemini.html">Gemini OBC</a> computers, my intention was
    originally to use the Gemini OBC assembler <a
      href="Gemini.html#yaOBCASM_the_OBC_Cross-Assembler"><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaASM</span></a> for both assembly
    languages.&nbsp; When assembling LVDC code, the command-line switch
    "--lvdc" is added.&nbsp; However, I never had any actual LVDC code
    to test it with when I made those changes to yaASM.&nbsp; Now that I
    have some actual LVDC source code, I've exploring a cleaner
    replacement for it that doesn't try to span the OBC world.&nbsp; The
    executive summary, though, is that as of right now (July 2019) we
    have no working assembler for LVDC code.&nbsp; Hopefully coming Real
    Soon Now.<br>

        As you will have noted if you've read this far, there are some
        pretty serious gaps in the publicly-accessible data about the
        LVDC and its software.&nbsp; If you know where to find any more
        information, please tell me about it.&nbsp; Examples of some of
        the things that would be interesting to have include:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Source code, source code, source code.&nbsp; Any computer
            source code—or for that matter, binary code—that ran on the
            LVDC would be useful:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Flight software.</li>
            <li>Preflight software.</li>
            <li>Test &amp; checkout software.</li>
            <li>Even sample code.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The source code of "the FORTRAN program", if there really
            is such a thing, from which the LVDC assembly-language was
            manually coded.</li>
          <li>Manuals explaning the syntax of LVDC assembly-language.</li>
          <li>Source code for the software run by the test &amp;
            checkout computers, as opposed to the LVDC itself.</li>
          <li>Any documents missing from the <a href="links.html#LVDC">Document

        Well, we haven't made much progress on the homage
        front.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a handful of names, though too few yet
        to really form any picture as to who did what.&nbsp; Hopefully
        be able to flesh this out somewhat as time progresses and to
        provide that info here.&nbsp; A lot of the information on this
        page that doesn't come directly from the surviving documentation
        is largely due to conversations with Barry Silverman, who has
        made a significant effort to find and talk to original LVDC
        developers.<br>
